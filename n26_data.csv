N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2022-05-26T22:00:45.000Z,Miserable customer service,"After 4 years I think that I have finally decided to change banks. The customer service is miserable, and I have never managed to get actual help over these past 4 years. The last straw has been a paycheck that got lost and never arrived to my N26 account. Customer service was unhelpful to say the least, and they would refuse to open an investigation. The sender's bank back-office contacted N26 to try to see what was happening but they never received an asnwer. Now suddenly the sender's bank has received a transfer from N26, this was not a rejected payment, but a new transfer initiated by N26, which means that N26 actually received the money, contrary to what all agents have told me these last days. I lost hours for a paycheck that I have never received, I have no way of finding out what went wrong,  as the N26 customer service is completely useless, and I won't trust this bank any longer with my money. Funny that Trustpilot asks for a case number, not only do I not have a case number, N26 doesn't even save the chats from customer assistance, and if one is not fast enough in typing one is kicked out from a live chat.","Hi Nina, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. For technical and security reasons the any receiving bank of a transfer cannot trace or disclose details about a transfer. This is a standard banking process. ,Whilst we appreciate that you feel that customer support was not helpful in this instance, there is not a technical process that can be followed from the receiving side that they could offer. On occasion it may be required to inform you of your options with the sending bank even if this means that customer support cannot directly solve this issue for you.,For example if details of a transfer were incorrect when supplied to N26 this would not be linked to your account and the only secure option would be to send the transfer back to the sending bank. It would not be a secure process to inform or deposit the funds to the most likely account as we may have customers with similar names or other details. ,Thank you for your feedback. We're sorry to hear that this process took longer than expected and may have not been made clear enough at the start of your inquiry. ,Best regards, Ben, your N26 support",/users/628fdc5a1298900012874046,1,FR

That was done without any warning.   ,On 4th of May 2022, I have received an email from bank, in which bank informed me that my account is cancelled effective immediately.  The N26 app stopped accepting my login/password. ,Regarding my remaining funds (around 4K EUR) which I had on my account, they stated: ,""It is currently not possible to withdraw the remaining balance on your N26 account. Please send us proof of the origin of the funds through appropriate receipts. We will then assess whether a payout of the remaining balance is possible. This information may be emailed as a scan or photo."",I replied to this mail with my latest broker account statement. There was no answer. I sent another email after two weeks - still no answer. I messaged N26 Support on twitter, they told my that they had tranffered information to relevant department. It has been three weeks passed already, and I still get no answer. ,Therefore, it looks like N26 decided not to continue any dialog with me. And also probably they decided to keep my funds.  I am not a terrorist, nor sanctioned person. I already suffered not being able to use my funds and my debit cards. ,There was no court order to part me with my funds.

I have my salary paid on my account, pay for groceries and have a monthly savings plan. That's it.,N26 stopped my account in the name of ""irregularities"", without warning, effective immediately, during a banking holiday  (easter weekend) to ensure there's really nothing I can do. I have read the (public) T&Cs, there is nothing that I violated.,I understand that fighting fraud is tricky and you may get it wrong from time to time. However, terminating instead of blocking is quite aggressive and getting it wrong on hundreds of accounts all over Europe (hundreds more at the same time during the easter weekend), failing to inform the clients and failing to answer (except for PR messages or press inquiries)? Unfortunately, according to our lawyer, this has become common practise at n26.,In my case, n26 not only removed my funds from my account (got proof of this) but then failed to bounce automatic transfers that happened immediately after the easter weekend and then informed my that my balance is negative (because they removed the funds) and I have to pay additional charges - even worse, there is no option for me to pay back anything (or even know how much I have to pay back) as the account does no longer exist. (""luckily"", the live chat answered for once and told me ""don't worry, the charge is only 3 euros""),Calling n26 tells me to use the live chat (automated message), live chat tells me to reply to the termination mail (right before closing the chat over and over again), replying to the termination mail tells me to reply to the termination mail (not kidding), sending to complaints@n26 (as hinted on replies on trustpilot) results in no answer, using social media to contact n26 (e.g., twitter) also results in no useful answer (besides fraud prevention, answer the mail you got etc.) and on trustpilot it seems that a certain text is stuck in the clipboard of an unfortunate employee.,I sincerely hope no one else has to ever experience the hell that n26 is putting me through.","Hi Vincent, ,Thanks for reaching out.

A bank that casually violates German/EU laws,"For several years I've been using N26 as my primary account for salary and other day-to-day transactions. I am a public servant in Germany and my ONLY source of income is my salary PAID BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT. I have not engaged in any activities that violate N26 regulations (at least those that are publicly available).,Suddenly my account has been cancelled without notice and now I have to prove the source of my income. This is pure insanity as all of my income comes from a government institution. Apparently N26 cannot identity German government transfers as a legitimate source of income!!! If that's not crazy, I do not know what is. ,In addition, N26 are violating German laws. It is true that banks have the right to terminate the contracts with their clients. HOWEVER, the money in your account is your property and CANNOT be frozen without a proper legal procedure that you should be fully informed about. Thus, plain and simple, N26 decision to block access to funds without proper legal procedure violates German and EU laws. ,Such blatant disregard for proper legal procedures calls for a lawsuit. This is the only way to force this funny ""wannabe bankers"" startup crowd into realization that they are a certified institution and should act like one.,EDIT: I see that ""Ben"" from N26 responded with the usual useless suggestions: N26 does not respond to any requests or complaints in reasonable time, and so it is ridiculous to suggest this course of action (which, for the record, I have tried). ,Some good news: It seems that N26 actions are already attracting some attention from the media, as well as from consumer rights lawyers and groups. There is a growing realization that N26 actions do not comply with BaFin legal framework. I encourage everyone affected to file a complaint with BaFin as soon as possible. Otherwise there is a good chance that you will not see your money for a very long time. Also, it is about time to make this ridiculous ""bank"" accountable for their unlawful actions.

If we are required to cease our business relationship we may not be able to disclose the cause for regulatory reasons. ,There are several reasons why N26 may block or close an account. These reasons come from our decision as a business to act in line with our risk management policies, as well as our need to comply with relevant statutory obligations outlined by our regulator Bafin. ,In simple terms, this means that N26—as a bank—needs to act in line with laws that exist to combat illegal activities such as money laundering, financing terrorism, tax fraud, and abusive or fraudulent use of the account. In these cases, access to an N26 account may be restricted, or the account may be closed.,If you have contacted our financial regulator and the complaints team to dispute this they will work together to review if any mistake as been made in the handling of this case.

The cost was not all that big either (USD 53).

After two weeks, paypal refunded the money to my N26 card, while N26 refuse to do anything without me getting a time consuming police report.,Conclusion: N26 only works ok as long as there is no problem.

In the end got the response that chargeback can last 120 days, which is the outcome if a update is provided within 8 days and that would mean N26 simply ""missed"" to write me on time.,Everything else was fine, but this gave me a idea for a start-up. Otherwise would give a shallow zero.","Hi Ivan, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear that the chargeback process is taking longer than expected to resolve.,The chargeback process is covered by Mastercards payment protection policies. It enables an impartial dispute process. ,From the scenario described it sounds like Opodo is disputing your chargeback request and may provide evidence to support their claim. In some cases this may be required to be arbitrated by Mastercard. ,Whilst we understand that this may be frustrating they will have a contractual time frame to submit this evidence.,The chargeback team will be in touch with you as soon as possible. ,Best regards, Ben, Your N26 Support",/users/62153485c02f940013ec0212,1,DE

They don’t even have a phone number to call in case of such disaster if you don’t have “PREMIUM” account, just because you’re not premium client, your whole account can be robbed in seconds and they don’t do anything for you.

However, I am not sure that this has so much to do with the quality of the chat conversations. Unfortunately, I have had rather unsatisfactory experiences with the N26 chat staff so far. As a general principle, the chat conversations were very one-sided; in the sense of ""taciturn"" and seemed insecure as far as the advisors were concerned. ,As a business customer of N26 with my own company, I also expect my bank to provide me with competent employees in the business customer area who shine with expertise and know how to help with practical solutions. I have now often encountered employees in the chat who seemed to me like teenagers who neither expressed themselves adequately nor used correct spelling or even bothered to do so.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2022-01-07T11:53:42.000Z,Nightmare ordeal,"Last year my phone was robbed in Ukraine and I had good reason to believe the money was stolen from my account. Initially the customer service advisors in the chat function did their best to help. We tried numerous new verification procedures to regain access to my account but for some reason none of these worked. Curiously the advisors believed my identity enough to block transactions from the account but not enough to tell me whether my money was there or not. Ludicrous in the extreme.,From that point on I was directed to the e-mail address where I outlined the problems I faced. Absolutely nothing back from them. E-mail after e-mail fell on deaf ears. I was still none the wiser as to the whereabouts of my money – was it there or not? Given that the incident involved me being drugged and beaten up I expected more concern from the bank. Perhaps a number to contact them would have been helpful given the seriousness of the crime.,In December I finally got an e-mail saying that N26 was terminated their relationship with me as of 31st December. I’m guessing this is because I failed the verification procedures or perhaps they think I am the fraudster trying to scam them. Who knows? Without being able to communicate with them I have no way of knowing what they are thinking.,They said they would transfer any remaining funds to my UK account but it is now 7th December and nothing received. I now then have to believe that the thugs who stole my phone got into my N26 account and siphoned off the money.,My next step in this nightmare is to fly to Germany and try to contact N26 directly, and also involve the German police. The bank now has a legal obligation, as far as I’m aware, to help me get that money back. ,I’ve been appalled by the actions of the bank in this situation. My mental health has taken a hit as I constantly worry what has happened to the money, and why the bank won’t help me.,If anyone from N26, or anyone who has been in a similar situation, is reading this please let me know what the next step is. I don’t want more e-mail addresses to direct enquires to that end in a brick wall of indifference. This has gone on too long now.","Hi Robert, ,We're sorry to hear that you have had difficulty receiving the transfer of your remaining funds after you could not gain access to your account after a failed verification process.,If you are considering taking legal action then the first step would like to make a formal complaint.

Now after 3 months I cannot transfer a new number to the account as I have lost my acces from the first number it was opened with. N26 will only allow Phone contracts in own name. In my case and I belive in many other cases we are having professional phones and only carry 1 phone in our lives. Since my employer is an international company they hold large general phone contracts and these are not associated with the general username like a privately held contract. Now more than 3 months later no resolution even if certificates from employer, passports and IDs, following their guidance have brought me anywhere. Simply a very unprofessional company when handling such a request. NOW I am blocked to control my own account visibility, shopping. I can only hope I run dry sooner or later on  the account in order for N26 not to keep the control with my savings. I am sorry to say things started out great, but have gone really bad.

N26,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,2021-12-26T00:56:43.000Z,Revolut vs N26,"Revolut vs N26,Ive been using Revolut and N26 for a year. Revolut beats N26 in all but one aspect...here's why:,Cards: Revolut provides virtual visa and physical maestro cards. The N26 virtual card is a maestro card, lot less online stores and shop terminals accept the N26 card.,Acceptance: the Revolut card is accepted almost everywhere in Europe and Brazil. In Brazil, the Cielo terminals, which are about 50% of all terminals, do not accept wireless payments with my mobile phone. They do accept payments with the physical Revolut card. All other terminals in Brazil accept payments using your virtual Revolut card in your phone. I was NOT able to pay with the N26 virtual card almost anywhere in Brazil. The N26 card is useless un Brazil. The N26 card was also rejected by some European airlines like TAP. KLM and Ryanair accept both In Europe, I was able to use both everywhere I tried.,Customer service: neither of them has a phone number to call. Both have a chat. In my experience Revolut has more extended, global opening hours than N26, waiting times seem to be equal. The clear advantage of Revolut is that you can send your query, close the app and open the message thread when an agent answers. N26 has a technical problem with this. Often when i receive a notification that they answered, i tap it but its impossible to get back to the messages and actually see their answer.,Access: you can install and use Revolut on 2 phones. So if your phone breaks or gets stolen, you can still access your money. With N26, if you lose access to your one ""paired device"" you are screwed. You can install N26 on 2 phones but only 1 can be your ""paired device"". If try to do anything with a device other than the paired one, N26 wants a confirmation on your paired device. So installing N26 on a second device is useless. Both have a idiotic 2-step verification, so if you lose access to your phone(s) you cant do anything on your laptop because they will be sending verification codes to your phone. This is also annoying if you use different SIM cards.,Security: Both have bad reputations blocking accounts, disappearing with the money and making it difficult for clients to get their money back. Both should work on this. Beyond that, this is the only point where N26 beats Revolut. N26 is a licensed german bank, so your money -up to 100k EUR- is protected by the EU deposit protection scheme. Revolut is a financial service provider, not regulated by the protection scheme. N26 left both the UK and US markets closing hundreds of thousands of accounts. Not a step that increases trust.,Purchase protection: I dont know if N26 offers purchase protection, basic Revolut doesnt. I see users complaining about it, read where you put your money...they are clear about the basic package not offering purchase protection.,Other: Revolut sent a physical card to Brazil within a week. Which is really cool. I dont have a physical N26 card so I cant compare. I can compare to my former idiot, address obsessed belgian bank ING, that still thinks its 1960 and people spend their lives living at one address. If you lose your Revolut card travelling, you can order a replacement for max 25 eur postage, to any address.

We do not offer euro accounts in Brazil or allow a customer to register a Brazilian address to a Euro account. ,If you opened your Euro n26 account whilst you were resident in Brazil then this will have also been a breach of our terms and conditions.,We would normally recommend to order a card for your account before travelling as it also functions as a back up for your account in cases of theft or loss. When you opened the account you will have declared residence in a supported market and had the option to order a physical card to that address.,Best regards, Ben, Your N26 Support",/users/55a611230000ff0001ccd014,8,BE

I cleared this up immediately with the creditor, who instructed N26 to lift the block. Twice. 9 days later, my account is still frozen — with all the terrible consequences that go with.

If one of your customers tells you they’re unable to buy food, medicine or pay rent because you’ve frozen their funds, maybe speed up the ‘document review’ process?

I went to Bank Sabadell, Interbank, and one or two other banks. All had some weird, extortionist fees or ""obligatory"" services. Sabadell told me I needed insurance with them for $40 a month. Interbank told me I needed a credit card, which I had to use once in a month (what?). Some wanted NIE number, passport, work contract, apartment contract, salary for last 6 months, blood sample, one kidney (last two are a joke) and so on.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-11-26T04:07:12.000Z,"Bad experiences, tipps for other customers and an attempt to explain why we all experience this","The quality of customer service is very variable. Most of the times it's unfortunately very bad and time consuming. If you are stuck, the best option you have is reaching out to their Twitter-Support-Team. Yes, you've read that correctly: Their Twitter support is better than the actual one in the app after you logged in. ,In our eyes N26 does not understand, or simply does not care about needs of business customers - regarding static limits for both business and personal customers, their poorly designed service and their unfortunately non existent internal processes to resolve issues. Even when their actions are harmful for their customers businesses, they will only care if you make your case public. ,We had two very bad experiences this year and are about to stop working with N26 in 2022. Today I asked their support, if we could make an appointment to discuss whether or not N26 would be able to fit our needs in the future and how this could be done. ,The answer we got was, that an appointment could be done, but they do not see why this would be necessary. We could just ask in the chat. The quality of the conversation would be the same. Means: They weren't even able to escalate this very kind request to a higher support level. ,Let's try an attempt on what we see here: N26 can not care about us or other customers too much at the moment. Customer support has to be as cost efficient as it can get. That's because customer satisfaction is no major KPI for investors. Growth and diversification are. Building up a multi language customer service is simply no easy task to do. From a strategic standpoint of a company this means, you will put most of your money in new commercial products (e.g. insurance), marketing, branding and protecting your brand (the twitter team) because it's more efficient and cheaper in comparison to be able to reach investors requirements for new investment rounds. As long as the level of new customers is high enough, customer churn rates can be put aside. You could say bad service is inevitable, because otherwise no new money for N26 and therefore no N26 at all. ,N26 received new investment money at the end of 2021. Maybe there will be a point on their roadmap to balance this out. But actually, it's not too realistic, if you know a thing or two about how investments in startups work and how overreaching investors can be in terms of theirs invested companies roadmaps. They are currently in a series e investment round, which means they met all investors requirements for at least five rounds. Which also means they are at the end of ""bulk business"". Next thing to do would be to make everything even more profitable by making processes more efficient (most of the times that means everything is getting worst for customers unfortunately). You can not really bypass this process if you are funded, because investors want to secure their funds and get advised profits as soon as possible. ,In conclusion: If you are just doing simple banking - N26 is cool and has a lot state of the art features other banks aren't able to offer. If you need to work with your banking partner from time to time (eg. as a business) N26 is currently not the right partner of choice. Simply because they are not able to meet individual needs at the current state.,I hope this is in some way helpful for people who are thinking about contracting with N26. All the best for you N26. Hope you will be able to break free from pressuring investor relations or even find a way to get everything working anyways so you can finally provide customers a level of service that is more adequate.","Hi,,Thank you for taking the time to leave your detailed review and feedback regarding the N26 business account. ,We're sorry to hear that you have found that the business account does not meet your current needs and may need to review your options. ,Best regards, Ben, Your N26 Support",/users/61a0340be16f3c0012c7fb80,1,DE

I was stolen in a scam on March and opened the refund process in the same month (according to EU law you can do so until 8 weeks after the transfer). N26 kept saying that the beneficiary bank was not replying, even though I had contacted them and they replied me in 3 business days. After my 8 weeks were done N26 closed my investigation without further details, and sent a generic response as usual. I opened a new case, since I had gotten the reply from the beneficiary bank and knew they were indeed replying. N26 took the money from my account (15 euros) for the investigation fee, and opened a new process. When I asked costumer support about it they took almost one week to tell me that they did not have any open processes. Then they started a third process just to tell me that the beneficiary bank had replied and since the funds were no longer in the scammer's account (of course, if you take six months to finally get in touch the funds will not be there), there was nothing they could do. I asked them to open yet again a new process and do their damn job, and have been ignored ever since. I am pretty sure they received the money back from the beneficiary bank and just kept it for themselves. Awful bank, almost no costumer support, complying with scammers.

In most cases the fraudster will transfer or withdraw these funds within the same day, often within minutes. This can make a positive outcome less likely.,To help prevent occurrences like this in the future we also recommend to report the fraud to your police force. ,It is also unfortunate that the receiving bank did not comply with our request or provide us with more details regarding your transfer. As we are the sending bank, we cannot force the receiving bank to reply to our request. For data privacy reasons the receiving bank is also not obliged to provide that to us. This may also relate to ongoing police investigations that may be security sensitive.,We are sorry if communication around this process was not transparent and that realistic expectations were not set.

We're sorry to hear that your bank card did not arrive. ,Whilst we appreciate that this may be frustrating, it is not possible to track a letter that is sent with standard local postal service. Tracked courier delivery is offered for an additional charge. ,As we cannot ""see"" the exact cause that a letter has not been delivered the best option is to cancel the card we previously sent and send a new card with a new unique number. ,Some of the most common reasons for missed deliveries are incomplete address details or customers using addresses shared by multiple people.,For example, in Germany most local postal services will not deliver to an address if the name on the letter does not match the name on the postbox.,We're sorry if this has caused any inconvenience. ,Best regards, Ben, Your N26 Support",/users/6187b7d6afe9fd00120c507b,3,DE

I was very convinced of N26, that has now changed. ,If you have a real problem with your account, you will not be helped. Customer service is impersonal and poor. Information is not forwarded and there seems to be little to no communication among each other. In addition, there is no way to get in touch with someone personally, which means no telephone customer service, for example. Therefore, it is very difficult to clarify and solve a problem. You always have to communicate with new employees via chat. These had in my case (there were 7 different!) all no idea and could not help me. Again and again I was told that the issue was passed on to the specialist department and that I should please be patient. Meanwhile, the second week comes to an end and nothing has happened! That is simply bad. In any conventional bank would have helped faster, I'm sure! Even a fax from the lawyer with the note ""Urgent! Please submit immediately"" was forwarded only after two days.

The support takes forever to receive a resolution. None of their representatives seem to know how to assist with any concern or issue. They just ask the same question over and over. They never provide useful information. They just keep telling you that you have all you need when you don't.

N26 messed up by not sending me my new card in time, after that they couldn't accept that this was not my fault I had the choice between paying 20€ for 3-day-delivery or waiting 2 weeks thus not being able to pay for anything for at least 9 days since my old card would be expired by then. The support told me that my current card would immediately be blocked, but the way it was worded that seemed to only apply to the express shipping, therefore I opted for standard shipping. As you can probably imagine they blocked my current card immediately and now I have no way to pay for anything in the (at least) next two weeks and monthly payments via credit card don't work either obviously.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-10-25T16:36:45.000Z,"Terrible 'bank', abysmal service and liable to literally hold your money hostage.","Everything was fine until I had my bag stolen- At the first opportunity I contacted N26 to inform them and was told that as I had lost both my paired device and phone number I would need to complete another verification call to regain access to my account. A couple of weeks later (I had to wait to obtain new ID to complete the process), I completed video verification successfully and immediately regained access without any issues. ,A few hours later I was locked out of my account with no explanation from N26 about what was happening. This happened on a Friday afternoon so I tried contacting them a few times and eventually decided to wait a little as I was confident it would soon be resolved. I was wrong. The following week was spent desperately trying to get answers from chat support. ,Though I was a premium customer, I could not contact them on the phone and kept asking for someone to give me a call so I could try to speak to someone about what was going on. Not only did they refuse to contact me but then agents took to lying to me about what was going on and when I could expect to hear from someone about my account. On one occasion I was even given a falsified 'callback code' and told someone would contact me within 24 hours. On another occasion I was told to have a little more patience and assured someone would be in touch by the end of the day. On another occasion I was asked to email about the issue which I did immediately-  to this day I have never received a response to that email or many of the others I sent in increasing desperation, as I tried to access my account or at the very least the money that was in it. ,Finally, 10 days after being locked out of my account, at 5pm on a Monday, I received an email informing me that my account was being cancelled in accordance with a section of the terms and conditions that literally did not exist. I had not done anything wrong- the only transactions I had completed were transfers to and from an account in my home country (UK), rental payments to my landlords in Germany and card payments for basic everyday expenses. In fact one of the very last items on my account before this happened is a salary I received from N26 themselves- yes that's right I am actually a former employee (though I opened the account before I actually worked with them). That means in this instance not only have they treated me appallingly as a customer but as an employer they are essentially withholding money that I earned legally and fairly under a section of the terms and conditions that nobody is able to properly cite, let alone explain. ,Anytime I try to follow up I am given niceties without action which I think most of us can agree is not helpful when you are experiencing financial hardship BECAUSE of an institution. As a result of all this I am now at risk of homelessness; unable to pay for health insurance, content insurance or legal insurance- because all of these things were tied to my account- and have even had to borrow money for food because I have no access to my own money or account. The account was also my only one in Germany, so now I am also unable to receive payments from my clients ( I am now a freelancer). ,The most frustrating thing is that all of this is happening for the simple fact that N26 cannot be bothered to implement proper recovery tools and instead find it easier to close an account than to come up with better processes to prevent this from happening. As a former employee, I know for a fact that they simply do not care to work towards improving this situation for their customers and instead hide behind the excuse of carrying out 'regulatory checks'. Other banks (both traditional and those in fintech) are also obliged to carry these out, yet they manage to do so in a fraction of the time because they have prioritised the acquisition of the necessary resources. N26 does not have the resources and though their expansion is rapid they lack integrity and therefore do not care to resolve these issues in a timely manner. ,In the short time I was there I observed a clear culture of distrust and contempt for the customer, systems designed to frustrate, poor data practices, abysmal security and an unwillingness to fix any gaps in their banking processes if it was not directly linked to an increase in their profits. ,As a customer, I now understand something that I strongly suspected but could not quite believe while I worked there- N26 simply do not care about you, your money or your financial security and no amount of pastel colours and targeted advertising will ever be enough to make up for the gaps in their service that create this reality. ,Avoid them like the plague or risk experiencing something similar.","Hey Efua, ,We're sorry to hear that your phone was stolen then this ultimately led to the closure of your account. ,As a licensed and registered bank we are governed by strict guidelines and laws.

They ignore your emails, they ignore when app doesn’t work, virtual card doesn’t work in the shops and atm. I made a complaint to Bafin German watchdog. The only way to contact them is through chat. Some arrogant kids chat with you probably from their homes. It is extremely difficult to have an account with that bank.they demand hundreds of codes to withdraw money.

Once you get an agent, each will have a different approach to solve the issue and most of them will be irrelevant address to send documents will differ from one agent to another.,3. For an internet-based Bank, they should also accept digital submission of certain documents, which they don’t…. And don’t even tell you beforehand.,4. To get sometimes your issue solved, it seems like you need to rant on social media, which i believe violates one Privacy Rights… who wants to come on social media to expose his/her personal bank issues? But for an email i sent to be read by N26 i needed to go on all their platforms( twitter, IG, Facebook…) which i find UNPROFESSIONAL.,5.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-10-02T12:24:29.000Z,Pathetic old-fashioned bank for fintech standards,"(Note: I'm comparing N26 here to other fintech banks, not ""regular"" banks.),I had to change my phone number and use a new ""un-paired"" phone. This was a ridiculously long and OFFLINE procedure. First, I had to chat to a support agent. They then told me I had to go withdraw money. What the hell? I thought this was a 100% online bank? And why should I have to withdraw money to confirm my identity? Also, because I can't access the N26 app, I cannot check where the nearby compatible ATMs are. Where's the logic here? ,Afterwards, I had to provide my ID card information, the withdrawal amount, and a 10-digit number that is on a card YOU'D HAVE TO ORDER SEPARATELY. Luckily, I had this maestro card with the required 10-digit number, but normally, you'd only have the mastercard which does not have this 10-digit number. You have to order the maestro card separately.,I thought that was it. But no, I was then told I would have to WAIT for a PHONE CALL. No instant SMS verification. No, a human would have to call between office hours within 24 hours. ,Absolutely ridiculous. If you're in an emergency or lose your phone, you are stuck. There is no added value to the web version of the online banking since you have to confirm your login using the app. As a customer, I expect to have 24/7 access to my account. These kind of offline, old-fashioned, time-intensive procedures are unacceptable for a supposed ""100% online, innovative"" fintech company.,There are much, much simpler and faster ways to to do this. I also have a bunq account and with that I can login in a browser using my email, or phone/QR code, or phone number. Easy. Multiple options. No paired device, I can install the app on any device and access my account at all times. No ridiculous offline ATM procedures and waiting around for phone calls.,It's 2021, but N26 is stuck miles behind other fintech banks. (Recently they've been showing off their instant bank transfers. Seriously? So many countries and banks already offer this. This is hardly new. Just shows how behind N26 and Germany are in terms of banking.),Will be closing my account soon and only using bunq and Revolut. At least those banks know what ""100% online"" means and offer better and more practical service.,Edit: You'll see from the reviews below that N26 defends these procedures as security necessities. N26, security is important, but I trust your competitors more because they understand speed and practicality and let me retain access to my account. They achieve the same goals in a much simpler and faster fashion and are equally if not more secure. It *is* possible to do things better and faster while maintaining security. N26's procedures are more of a reflection of Germany's overly-complicated protocols fetishism than of security requirements, which becomes clear when comparing N26 to competitors and when reading the other reviews here.","Hey Doro, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave a detailed critique of our security processes.  We're sorry to hear that you have found this inconvenient. ,The process you have outlined is to grant access to your account if you do not have access to your registered phone number or paired phone. We are bound by regulation to verify that the person requesting access is the account holder. ,If a customer still has access to their account they can update their phone number and pair a new phone without following this ID verification process. ,If there was a situation where a customer did not have a bank card we can follow alternative verification processes. ,I must also clarify that all of our physical cards (including Mastercard) are issued with a token number. ,Best regards, Ben, Your N26 Support",/users/6158496f46bc2a001212dd08,3,DE

This can mean that customer services cannot instantly reverse a transaction as it is part of a dispute process that is handled by a specialist team. ,To prevent further charges you would need to arrange to order a new bank card with customer support. You will need a new card number to keep your account sure as a fraudster could make further payments via other routes if they have your card details.

At 08.30 the Airline informed us that we will be rebooked on other flights to our destinations. KLM rebooked me on Aeroflot getting in about 8 hours late and due to other issues I can not fly via Moskva, so for 3 hours was on the phone with different KLM related entities. Finally a great call agent were able to book me on Finnair getting in at around 5 pm instead of the original 11 am KLM flight.

Withdrawal processed and then refunded the money back to my account. Tried again--same thing. No explanation. Used another card & it worked fine so was not the ATM. Then I got a message that I had used up 2 of my ATM transactions for the month. Trying to find out what happened and why was a nightmare. Started with Twitter as the ""live chat support"" didn't work. The phone chat kept notifying me someone was there, but when I clicked on it I had to log in and it would not accept my credentials. Next app notification, a page came up saying ""chat support not available."" The N26 Twitter support is a waste of time as they cannot 'see' your account so cannot tell you what happened--just run you in circles with scripts. Live chat support online never showed up after 2 hours. Finally emailed support. Said they would get back to me in 3-5 business days! Finally filed a complaint as I had no idea how to communicate with this company. Dealing with a 'bank' that you cannot contact is not a great idea. In addition, you will read online that there is a basic 'free' account. But if you do not pay them a monthly fee of 5, 10 or 16€ per month, you do not receive a physical debit card to use. I don't really know the point of having an account without a debit card if you want to withdraw cash or pay with a debit card, so basically you have to pay an annual fee. It is not free. They are very busy trying to get new customers with referral payments, but cannot seem to deal with the customers they have. N26 seems to be very understaffed and unable to help customers in a timely manner. If you never have an issue--maybe it's fine. But not being able to find out information about your funds in a bank is not a good way to do business. I did not realize how bad the customer service is until I needed it. When you open the account--you get responses immediately. After that--good luck.,Update--I am updating as I discovered after wasting my time for hours following the advice of N26 social media support, there is a phone no. for the bank to speak with live people, and my questions were answered in minutes. But I had already filed a complaint as 'support' had advised. So the bank's cost-saving measure of outsourcing to external support is actually costing them money as they are wasting bank employees' time by having to answer complaints as advised by ersatz 'support' personnel.

It means that you are not able to pay your taxes or receive unemployment money to your N26 bank account in Spain.

When opinions are strongly divided between 5 and 1 stars there is an issue. I experienced the horror of having to deal with N26 personally and how poorly it is ran.  Do not trust your financial resources with this startup. It will only result in loss. In May I opened an account. 2 months later, no cards were received at my residential address which was correctly provided. I contacted support to send the card again. 1 month later: no progress. They offer to send the card express without any cost. Next, they decide to debit my account in full for the shipping (€30). I have various conversations with support again and 3 weeks later they return €25. Besides all of the wasted time and energy, having no proper access to banking they steal money from their customers. Save yourself the misery and open an account with an established bank. This company is being ran from a kindergarten and the service you extensively pay for is not provided.","Hey Laure,,We're sorry to hear that you had difficulty receiving your bank card.,We advise you to check the following guidelines for our card delivery.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-08-17T15:18:17.000Z,The worst bank I've ever dealt with,"I have no idea why this bank has good reviews online, it's absolutely the worst! ,I joined because it stated that I could have different currencies on my account. When I got paid for my first invoice with the company I'm working with, nothing showed up... ,Then I had to go through the hell that is trying to speak with their customer service... The first time, someone answered straight away, only to tell me they couldn't help and would put me through to someone who could. It was incredibly confusing to know if I was being put through to someone else because I kept getting a message asking if my query had been resolved, first when they said they were putting me through to someone else and then every time I was checking with them if I was actually being put through. Then I waited for quite a while before someone answered and when they did, they mentioned I couldn't be paid in foreign currency, unless it was done through Wise, which was not explained properly when I joined. I thought I was losing my mind but when I did a quick google search, one of the results from N26 themselves (an ad on Google) confirmed they memory I had of them oversimplifying the offer. Luckily I did a screenshot because I just tried to search again and that result is no longer there. I didn't retrace my research again because that will take a long time but I did my due diligence before selecting this bank, and my decision was based on the fact that I could easily receive money in a foreign currency. They said that they money should bounce back in a week's time and if it didn't, then the sender would need to open an investigation to understand what happened. ,I wanted to make sure I had all my details right so I went to find my chat history and obviously it's nowhere to be found. I then started a chat and waited 30 minutes before anyone answered. When they did, they felt like they were a machine to be honest and were completely unhelpful at first. Finally I got them to give me some answers and they said that they had my chat history but couldn't send it to me. SERIOUSLY??? I was livid... They said that the only option I had was to select to save the current chat after I ended it... By then I had ZERO trust in them so I did screenshots of the entire conversation. At the end of the conversation, I mentioned that I couldn't see an option so save the chat and their response was literally ""You have to end the chat first."" Surprise, surprise, I ended the chat and there was NO OPTION AT ALL to save it. Good thing that I knew not to trust anything they said and got the screenshots earlier. ,Regarding the payment, they asked me if I'd received a message from them regarding foreign currency transfers. I had no memory of that, so I went to check my messages and I was correct, I never received that message. The only message that was similar was one informing me that they would introduce fees for SWIFT transfers in foreign currency, which had nothing to do with my issue. In terms of the amount of time it would take for the money to re-appear in the sender's account, this time they said it would be within 7-10 working days, so who knows, if I ever ask again it might be another random number...,I have now created an account with TransferWise (also known as Wise), which so far seems a lot more transparent. Fingers crossed!,In summary: DO NOT GET AN ACCOUNT WITH N26, THERE ARE ENOUGH HORROR STORIES ON TRUSTPILOT AND ONLINE THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PUT YOU OFF.","Hey, ,Thank you for leaving us a review. ,We are sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our support. ,You can save a chat transcript if you started it as visitor in our support center (not logged into your account).

But no luck so far!,I show them my passport during the video verifications, but somehow they don't verify me.

How can someone not verify when I show them my documents!,So now, I cannot access my account from the past 9 days, nor will they get back to me with a logical response. ,I'm blind-sighted and have no clue as to what is going on. Their live customer support keeps on chanting the same ""dumb"" things over and over again ""we have escalated your case to the teams"".,I'm pretty sure it's not being taken care of, cuz it doesn't take a ""100% online bank"" 9 days to acknowledge a human email reply to a customer.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-08-16T13:20:37.000Z,"I am Syrian, I am human, I am worthy","I am an international MBA student from Turkey, I am Syrian and I have recently arrived in Berlin/Germany, and I was excited to start my life as a student there. I have to open a bank account to receive my payouts from the blocked account and I was recommended to use N26. I liked the flexibility and the plans, so I started the registration process and downloaded the app as instructed, and just as everything was going smoothly, I was interrupted by a message from them telling me that they won't open an account for me until I obtain a new nationality. This was very upsetting and unnecessary, being Syrian doesn't automatically means that I am a criminal, Syrians have been living all over the world and had opened many accounts in different parts of the globe since many years ago, even before the war happened. There is absolutely no need for such discrimination and treatment, I don't care if there was a bureaucratic, diplomatic, or whatever reason for this. Different conditions should apply to different people, especially those who are perfectly legal and following the rules accordingly and to the letter. Just because I am Syrian, that shouldn't mean that I am unworthy of an online bank account. I came to Germany seeking better and fair treatment, only to be shocked by your discriminatory behavior and rules. If we are to develop as human beings, we should start by setting aside unnecessary obstacles in the face of honorable and potentially loyal customers, as a progressive method of banking, I was quite shocked by your backward way of dealing with people, you can be better by projecting an image of tolerance and acceptance rather than fear and discrimination. I know I can't change anything by writing this review, but at least I can say something about it and share it with other people to let them know that Syrians are people just like everybody else, we have responsibilities and obligations and we need to secure our finances just like everybody else.

N26,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,2021-06-18T08:58:48.000Z,Everything is great... until it isn't.,"TL;DR:,+ Opening an account takes about five minutes.,+ The base model is free.,+ Both the web- and iOS-app are very intuitive and easy to use, can't say anything about the Android-app.,~ The support chat is not very useful unless you reach the right person.,- If you use the free plan and have to reinstall the app for some reason, you'll be locked out of both your bank account and any associated cards.,-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --,FULL REVIEW:,I switched to N26 about a month ago and I was really happy. The setup is quick and easy, there are (in the lowest plan of course) no recurring fees and adding the card to Apple Pay was done in minutes.,Unfortunately, there was (or still is?) a small bug in my account (the app had a big popup telling me that I have to add funds (which I did right at the initial setup) to activate the card (which I was already using in stores)), which led to me contacting the support. After waiting about 20 minutes in the chat and then talking to them, they suggested that I remove my connected phone, uninstall the app, restart my phone and reinstall the app afterwards. Didn't make much sense to me as the error appeared on my PC and Mac as well, but sure - I thought - why not? Can't get any worse - I thought. After removing the app from my account through the web interface, I was automatically logged out from the website and therefore the support chat. No big deal, I just logged in again and started a new chat. Waiting another 20 minutes, explaining everything to a new employee who then just transferred me to the previous employee (alright.. makes sense... I guess). After explaining that I successfully went through all the steps mentioned above, they told me I had to re-verify my account, because there is no other way to register the app. For the re-verification they had to un-verify me first. I thought no problem, shouldn't take long, didn't take long when I created the account. Unfortunately the email to verify my account never arrived. So I logged in again, started yet another chat, waited another 20 minutes and explained everything to employee number three (this time they didn't redirect me to the first employee for some reason). This (so far) last employee told me that they ""escalated"" the ticket, but the support is closed for now. Apparently they'll contact me next week. This is my main bank account where I receive my monthly income and from which I pay all my bills and subscriptions.,If you don't (want to) use physical money and are happy with a credit card or Apple/Google Pay, this is probably the bank for you. Compared to R*****t, N26's web app gives you the same features as the phone app, which is a huge plus in my eyes. If you choose one of the premium plans, you also get insurances and other extras.,For now I can't fully recommend it, because my experience with the support wasn't the best so far, but we'll see what the next days bring.,UPDATE: ±0 Stars,1. The email arrived after about twelve hours and I was able to re-verify my account. Unfortunately we're just back to where we started as the initial problem wasn't resolved.,UPDATE: +2 Stars,1. Since the re-verification from the first update was done within 24 hours and it didn't cause any issues with automated payments or subscriptions, I'll add one star for it not being a big issue after all.,2. The second star I'm adding is for the quick reply here on Trustpilot which was followed by a short email conversation. I'm hoping we can resolve the issue in the next week.,3.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-06-12T20:46:47.000Z,DO NOT USE FOR BUSINESS ACCOUNTS.,"I have had a really positive experience with personal accounts, so I decided to try a business account.,The business account is a business account by name only, it lacks basic features that are needed by many businesses, even self-employed sole traders. (Especially if you plan on growing your business beyond making pennies). ,Firstly, you can't have an account in a business name, it must be in your own name. They say that the reason is because their business account for sole-traders but even sole traders have registered business names—which are often better used on accounts for tax and business purposes. ,For example, to sell on Amazon, they are more likely to accept an account in your business name. They will outright not accept N26 as a business account, not even for personal proof of address. ,N26 do not have any process to get a Creditor ID for direct debits or SEPA transfers - often a basic requirement for a business in Europe. They ""Do not offer this feature"". A Creditor ID is not a ""feature"", its a financial process to register your business to instill trust in customers. ,They block large transfers. Because their support is never spoken, always with random people, getting real support is hard.,It's impossible to have a personal and business account at the same time, removing the ease of dealing with the same bank for all your needs. I also think this highlights the fact that their ""business"" account is not a business account at all, but actually a personal account with slightly different T&Cs.,Personal account - 5 stars,Business account - 0 stars as it's not a real business account. Calling it that is just an advertising ploy.,EDIT RESPONSE TO N26:,Freelancers and the self-employed  working under their own names often STILL have customer-facing business names. Having one doesn't exclude the other.,The inability to use an N26 account EVEN for personal verification processes highlights a serious issue with calling it a ""business account"". It was refused by Amazon, a local bank and a payment site for personal address verification—not business address verification, which would be even more rigorous. ,Also noted the lack of response to issues like blocking transfers or no Creditor Ids given (which can be given to sole traders working under their own names by every physical bank I know).","Hey Rory, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about our Business account. ,As stated on our website the N26 Business account is designed for self-employed and freelance users doing business under their own name. ,That means you can’t have your company’s name on the account or card.,Best Regards, ,Peter, ,N26 Support Team",/users/56f041030000ff000a109d39,6,IE

If you re-orient within the N26 webpage (e.g. goes from the starting page to card services pages) the Customer support chat restarts. Hence you need to stay on the same page within N26 throughout the full support errand. This was particularly a problem when the support agent asked me to go and look at another page. This means one has to restart the support chat and most likely will be given a new support agent.,- Inability to provide customer service to customers without physical cards (also if you read my comment above this is ironic as they cannot send me a physical card...), A digital bank should have a more solid verification system in place - if you rely on physical cards you are not a ""digital"" and ""International"" viable option - sorry to break it to you.,*Edit 2*,- re-verification was not approved within 8 days (5 working days) which is what they promise on the website.,*Edit 3*,- Changed review from 1 star to 3, as I got access to the video verification (previously not accessible in my device due to above stated UX bug).

So far so good, even though you only get a ""digital card"". This in itself is not too bad for use with online shopping and for 10 bucks you get a plastic card mailed to your home. ,Well, in theory! Before you even open an account you provide all your personal data (KYC and AML requirement). Once you have done so, including passport photos, you get to activate location data on your phone for ""extra security"". Right. extra tracking that is. If you decline, you get logged out and need to log in and start over with the passport info, etc. ,In all, the app is just a data phishing tool which leaves you with no way to open an account if and when you do not grant full access to location and everything else. If you want to resolve this by contacting support, there is no support, no even an email address or chat listed on the website. You have to ""move to the app"", which only works once you provide all details and access. ,I get it, there is no such thing as free lunch and there are stringent regulatory requirements with regard to personal data.

I was super chilled by this time because I was sure this is just a small bug and that N26 support would fix this in a minute. I contacted the Support and from there on everything went downhill. After I explained my problem literally the first answer I get was „I think this is something my colleagues have to check tomorrow“ I was shocked .. I than explained that it is urgent to find a solution, the N26 employee than resetted  my card and told me to wait 30minutes and that it would work afterwards. As may can imagine it didn’t, I ended up having the worst night in a baaaaaaaad baaad hostel somewhere in nowhere payed with luckily some cash I had left ... and no explanation since on what kind of problem that was..","Hey Kevin, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. ,We sorry to hear you've had issue with a car hire company. ,Often, car rental companies will take very large deposit before hiring out a car. As the card linked to your account is a MasterCard Debit card as apposed to Credit you would need to have a large amount of funds available to cover the deposit. ,Once the rental company takes this large deposit they can also hold on to it for 30 day before releasing it back to your account. ,Best Regards, ,Peter, ,N26 Support Team.

We are not at liberty to divulge any further information on the account. Your bank would need to contact us in regards to a Payment Investigation, but this does not guarantee the retrieval of the funds.,Unfortunately, it is a lot harder to retrieve funds that are sent via bank transfer as it would be with card payments. We are unable to stop a transfer that has already been received and withdrawn from the account.

She had been using the App and account for all her transactions. Then about 2 days ago she received a notification that her card has been locked. When I enquired all I kept being told was compliance check and all. Shortly after she received an email that her account was being closed. Although it was absurd and not acceptable, there was nothing to do... Then I started to check that if there are some people who have faced same kind of issue. the result is there are a lot of people who faced the same issue. To be honest now we are worried about our money after checking the reviews. it seems that it will be hard to get our money. I had trusted this bank, I use this account even for salary. But after today I will also close my account. absolutely unreliable,PS edit after their classical reply: there are %20 bad comment about them but they are still using a template for their reply. They do not say something different in their mails. ,I'm tired of hearing and reading to the same explanation (regulation , safety, bla bla ).I highly recommend you: change the regular checks you make and make a clear explanation to your customers.,We trusted you and only opened an account from you in Germany and now you are asking us to provide another account number in Germany.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-02-11T01:08:55.000Z,Frustrated with N26,I opened my Account with N26 last year in October and I was quite impressed with the fast service and easy sign up process. I had been using the App and account for all my transactions. Then about 2 weeks ago I received a notification that my card has been locked. When I enquired all I kept being told was compliance check and all. Shortly after I received an email that my account was being closed. Ok.. Confused.. Disappointed.. So I was instructed to provide details of another account where they could transfer my remaining balance to. So I managed to open an account with another bank and provided the IBAN and BIC details to N26. Checking the N26 account later on I see they've done a transfer having debited all the money that was in my account but the transfer details didn't correspond to the ones I provided. I've tried to enquire but all my emails have gone unanswered. Then now they've gone ahead and charged me twice for failed debits from this account so now the account has a negative balance. Mind you they are the ones who informed me all transactions had been stopped. So now I don't have the money which was in my N26 account and the account has a negative balance. Where was the money transferred to? Is anyone going to try and resolve this issue for me? I feel very frustrated and disappointed by how N26 has treated me the past few days. No empathy at all. I may not be a customer but I still deserve some form of empathy. I've had no access to money for almost 2 weeks. I still support my family including my 4year old son back in my home country.

But I just faced the issue, I payed the regular rent I’m paying each month almost 200£ on 1st of December, five days latter I got the notification to confirm outstanding payment and I confirmed it, and N26 made another payment. Then I checked it out and it was a double payment. When I contacted N26, they told me it was my mistake and I inserted my pin on 6th of December as well, which is true, but I did that as I though based on the “fake notification of the outstanding transfer”, that my payment from 1st of December haven’t been proceeded. I would resolve this issue easy on my own with my landlords, but when I tried to download transfer confirmations, I got the same confirmations with the same date of 1st of December for both of the payments, so I’m missing the evidence to resolve my problem. And N26 told me to resolve my problem on my own, as they investigated the case and as I inserted the pin, that means it was my mistake. Can you imagine how I’m currently feeling, like I don’t have control over my money, I completely lost the trust.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2021-01-11T16:14:26.000Z,"N26, not really a bank by any stretch of the imagination.","I live and work in Spain but am British by birth. I have a UK bank account but with Brexit looming on the horizon I decided it would be prudent to open a Spanish bank account.,I did my research over a period of a few weeks and decided to go for N26 because they seemed to offer one of the best overall packages. Just how wrong I was will be explained in the following paragraphs.,I applied for my account around the beginning of April 2020 and was accepted within literally minutes. This surprised me as I was informed on the sign-up screen that the process would take 24 hours. Anyway, the sign-up process was complete, I had been accepted and the account was ready to use. My metal (literally) debit card turned up some weeks later so everything was going simply fine.,Covid 19 had raised its ugly head at the beginning of the year and as with many countries Spain went into lockdown and almost all employees throughout the country were eventually laid off or furloughed. I have worked in Spain on contract for many years and so I was entitled to ERTE (a benefits payment system for people who are paying into the system). This is around the time that I began to suspect that N26 was not a real bank.,My company’s accountant informed the ERTE social department of the bank account numbers of all the employees where I worked, including my new N26 account number. Some time passed and everyone except me began receiving their furlough payments. I just assumed that because mine was a new account that it may take some time to get things set up correctly. Some more time went by and my colleagues started receiving further ERTE payments. In fact, everyone that I worked with was receiving payments except for me.,I subsequently opened a chat session on my N26 app and asked if there was any reason that I was not receiving my ERTE payments into my account. I was absolutely stunned to find out that N26 do not have an agreement with the Spanish social security departments to handle these payments. A bank that is not authorised to have benefit payments paid into it by a government body is, to my way of thinking, sadly lacking a vital service to its customers. I did some fast research on this problem and sure enough there were many N26 customers complaining about this lack of service.,Then, just a few days ago I entered a main Spanish bank and tried to pay some cash into my N26 account. I was told by the teller that N26 is only listed as having one address in Spain and that (again) they DO NOT have a certain agreement with the main banks and therefore I cannot pay cash into my account.,So, once again, yesterday I found my self on a chat session with N26 customer service and found out to my utter amazement that it was true; I cannot pay cash into my account from any of the main Spanish banks. However, I can pay cash in via the Post Office, the bloody Post Office. Please bear in mind that we are now in the year 2021 and not 1981. I spoke to two customer service people after I finally got around the computer bot that aparently always starts the chat. The second person I spoke to was helpful, but the first person refused to connect me with a supervisor and eventually cut me off.,The customer service from N26 is, in my opinion, absolutely dreadful. They are reading from a script that they are not allowed to deviate from.,So, to finally cut to the chase, N26 can not receive ERTE benefit payments from the Spanish government and because they only have a single presence in the whole of Spain, I cannot pay cash into my account.,I’m now beginning to wonder just what other services they can’t provide for my 16.50 euro per month.,N26, not really a bank by any stretch of the imagination.","Hi Allan,,We’re sorry for this situation. The SEPE isn’t able to make payments to your account as we’re not yet considered a “collaborator” by Social Security. Unfortunately, there won’t be a solution for this in the short-term.,We do not have a cash deposit system available in Spain.

Everything went smoothly, until I tried to make an outgoing transfer to pay my rent. I unfortunately forgot my PIN so I requested a new one, which requires a re-verification of your ID.,So I proceeded with a re-submission of the same ID that I used when I initially opened the account approximately (3 weeks prior). Since then, I have been literally locked out of my account with no access to the app nor my funds.,I have been contacting the customer service team via chat everyday for a week now, and so far I have been told me 2 things repeatedly: ,- my issue has been escalated to the ""emergency"" team,- someone will get in touch with me ""very soon"" or ""in 1 to 2 days"" via my registered email or by phone.,After almost 10 days and counting without being contacted at all by anyone at N26 (neither by email or phone) regarding my case, I think it is now safe to say that the customer service team was lying, plain and simple. ,The most recent turn of events was today, when 4 different customer service support agents just closed the chat on me directly after I asked for a status of my case, and didn't even give me a chance to respond.,Meanwhile, my entire income being on this account I am now homeless in a foreign country (and I do not speak the language) due to my inability to pay my rent because of this so-called bank.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-12-17T21:19:10.000Z,This bank has ruined the lives of my…,"This bank has ruined the lives of my family and I. Back in October, around the 30th, we awoke to our account being randomly closed and we were told that they would not be giving us any further information. I believe the vague reason they wrote in their email was that “we weren’t a good fit given our account usage”. Something to the effect of that. First off, this bank doesn’t have late fees, and that means that if you don’t have enough money in your account the charge is simply declined. So, with that in mind what could we have POSSIBLY DONE to warrant a response like this? Well, I’ll tell you, we enjoy using draft kings for sports betting. Which is completely legal where we live and we’ve done it since we’ve had the account so why the problem now? Well, because we actually won some money this year I guess. It doesn’t matter much now since we’re now a day away from eviction. ,Moving on, so, they sent the check containing all of the money that was in our account and the total was just over 5,000$.,Now, anyone that’s ever had a check over 5,000$ may know that they are impossible to cash without a bank account. We tried to have a friend deposit it for us but said friends bank sent us back a copy of the check and so the saga with N26 continued. ,I’ll remind everyone that the bank cancelled our account at the END OF OCTOBER which means mere days before rent is due. Great. Ya know, a great big F you from the bank, but it has now been almost 2 months since this whole thing started and we only JUST LAST WEEK got ahold of one of their supervisors who finally got the check reissued. My fiancé had called the bank no less than 100 times in the course of the month of November to try and get the check reissued or get the funds deposited into his PayPal (something they couldn’t do of course). Our only course of action if we ever got the reissued check was to take it to a payday loan place and pay over 200$ to cash the check that’s just over 5,000$. (We now owe 3,000 of it to our landlord and my fiancé has been out of work since November due to Covid since he’s in the service industry). ,Well, it’s now mid December. The supervisor for N26 said last week that the check was FINALLY reissued and should arrive within 7-10 days (WHO HAS TIME TO WAIT THIS LONG ON THE EDGE OF EVICTION!!!!),This was last Wednesday that they allegedly mailed the check.,It is now Thursday of the next week. We got our eviction pay or get out notice last Friday. We have UNTIL TOMORROW!!!!!! ,Still. No. CHECK. Today. ,If it doesn’t come tomorrow we’re screwed. So, this is my review.,Thanks N26! I’ve never been evicted before in my life. Guess it’s one for the life experience books. F-me right? I’m a nobody in the grand scheme of things to you and your company right? Well, know this, I will tell every single person I know to tell every person they know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK! ,Oh, it’s a pandemic. In case you didn’t know. ,Thanks.

If there are insufficient funds, the agreed upon fees must still be paid. You may go into an unauthorised overdraft if this happens,You can also go into an unauthorised overdraft via card payment. If you make a payment with insufficient funds in your account, and the merchant doesn't have internet connection, the funds will be charged to your  card. This occurs because the payment terminal cannot detect the insufficient funds due to its lack of internet connection. Once the payment terminal recovers connection the money will be debited from your account. If you don't have sufficient funds at this time, you'll incur a technical/unauthorised overdraft.,We will always notify a customer if they remain in unauthorised overdraft for an extended period of time via email. If the account has not been balanced in the requested timeframe, it is possible that the account will be terminated.,Best, ,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",/users/5fcba59f33b62e00193f5c15,1,GB

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-11-17T11:18:53.000Z,Great (until something goes wrong),"Trustpilot asks me to ""leave out offensive words"" so I will try my best to do it.,Before starting to read this, please take a look at this N26 support page, especially to the first common reason of bank transfer failure: Google ""Failed SEPA Transfers - N26 Support Center"" and open the first link. ,Is it clear, right? If ""the recipient's name on the transfer order is different from the name on their account (must be their name as written on their ID)"" the bank transfer must fail (I'm using ""must"" because they use it as well and it seems that it's mandatory that the recipient's name must be correct).,Now, let's try to do a little experiment together: find a friend/relative of yours which has an N26 account and do a bank transfer to them but instead of using the ""name as written on their ID"", use a casual one (a random string, whatever comes to your mind). Result? The bank transfer is correctly performed.,Moreover, they specify the following: ""To get a transfer, you'll only need to provide the sender with your full name (as it's written on the ID you provided for verification) and your IBAN."". So why N26 is accepting bank transfers even if the recipient's name is wrong? Who knows...,Here is my story in very few words: I have got scammed (07/07/2020 - 420 euro - not so much but worth investigating). The bank transfer has been done from an N26 account to an N26 account.,I naively based EVERYTHING on the fact that the recipient's name must be right and if a bank allows to create a bank account with a fake ID, well, they should be held accountable for that. My fault, will use PayPal from now on.,The first thing I did was to report the fraud to German Police. Once completed, I started to write to N26 support to get this sorted out (first message on 20/07/2020). In the very first reply they stated that they ""will get in touch with the recipient's bank and try to arrange a transaction reversal"": I then kindly replied that the recipient's bank was N26 itself and asked for a better estimation. Then silence mixed to very generic ""we will get back to you when we know more"" replies came in.,Yesterday (16/11/2020), after more than one month of complete silence, I decided to open a chat instead of replying to the message thread: a support agent opened the discussion very kindly, they suggested me to check my spam email (...) and then the magic happened: ""I see your concerns and I understand your frustration. I will contact the relevant department. Thank you. If you have no further questions I will have to close this chat."". Then I asked if they have an ETA and they told ""I have no more to add to this."".,So, since you are so proud of your simplicity and transparency, could you please tell me what's going on here? Is it really taking more than five months to investigate on a case where the recipient's bank is you?,This is not how you should treat customers for serious issues - we're all good to support customers when they're just fine.","Hi Alessandro,,We regret to learn that this has happened to you.,If you action a SEPA transfer to another bank account, it will be carried out providing the recipient's account is open and functional. A common reason for failed SEPA transfers, as listed in our Support Center article, is due to the fact the name differs. The reason we recommend matching the name on the transfer to the name on the account, is due to the fact we carry out routine checks on user transactions. If the transfer is deemed unusual or is high, we may reach out to the recipient to ask for proof of the origin of the transfer. ,It can prove considerable more difficult to retrieve funds that are sent via a SEPA transfer than it is for a card transaction. For a bank transfer to be carried out via N26, you must give your consent twice - the consent to transfer the funds that is prompted in the N26 app, as well as entering your secure PIN to confirm the transfer. For this reason, we always advise only transferring money to accounts of people that you know personally. ,We hope that this issue can be resolved for you ASAP.,Best Regards,,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",/users/5fb39fff3113ab001a51fb23,1,DE

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-10-07T11:37:57.000Z,Terrible service with ID verification,"I have decided to open a bank account but the verification via phone has just wasted my 2 hours. You wait for 20-30 minutes until you connect and receive commands, but if you do not respond immediately they just terminate the connection. Once you decide to wait in front of the screen for such a long time -so that you can respond to commands immediately- still no success: the connection is being terminated again with no explanation. It could be much easier to go to a real bank and open an account, which I will do. So, if a bank already gives you a terrible service while you are trying to become a customer, what kind of a service would you expect once you are a customer and encounter some type of problem? You judge yourself. The first impression is very bad and I decided to open an account from a different bank.","Hey Burak,,thank you for reaching out about this.

We will notify the account holder if there are insufficient fees to cover the scheduled payment so that you can arrange for the balance to be sufficient. ,You can view the list of prices and services here: https://docs.n26.com/legal/06+EU/01+Account/en/13account-pricelist-en.pdf,We follow SEPA guidelines for bank transfers. If the sending bank supports SEPA Instant, then you will receive your transfer immediately. If they do not support SEPA Instant, regular SEPA guidelines of 1 working day will apply. This can stretch to 2 days, depending on the time the transfer was made, and based on the processing hours of the participating banks.,Best Regards,,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",/users/5f63d770a70863c3a25c668d,1,DE

For me this would be very interesting, if it worked properly, but unfortunately it doesn't work at all!,Going straight to the point and being very objective, I paid this monthly fee assiduously for practically a year and a half, while I didn't need any sort of coverage or any kind of services offered by the N26, believe it or not, at the moment when I needed it most, in the middle of the pandemic situation (covid 19) there was no coverage at all. I tried to contact the Allianz insurance from N26 that I was supposed to  be covered, and I had no positive return/results. It Was denied actually.

More specifically, my car payment which requires us to call the bank and both give consent to charge his account for my car.  Due to the pandemic we haven't had the time to go to a bank and open a joint account, I thought this would be easier.  The problem is...like most people....my car payment is well into the $300s, but you can only transfer up to $150 at a time.  Additionally, I can't even transfer money because they require your name to be on the account or card you are transferring from...if I had a debit card with my name on it, why would I need a second debit card to transfer my money to? In all honesty, this bank works for one situation alone.  You have no one you want to transfer money to EVER, and you have a job that pays you via direct deposit.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-08-28T16:39:09.000Z,Single father with wheelchair bound son is lied to and stolen from by N26,"This situation would be laughable if not for the fact that I have a terminally ill son whom I am the sole provider for and with covid 19 finances are tight. So I am a member of a credit union and have been for some 10 years. I opened this N26 account when they first expanded to the United States. I sell on posh, offer up etc etc and I buy a lot of goods from China directly. So I keep my living checking account and my online/virtual accounts separate. Recently after receiving my school refund my Apple phone was stolen and on it in the wallet case was both my bank cards. So I had about 6 charges that were made on my credit union card and 2 made on my N26 card. So naturally I file a dispute with both the credit union and N26. So a little time goes by and I receive a letter from my credit union saying in accordance with regulation E they have provisionally credited my account. (Bare in mind that all 6 charges disputed with unify have since been found fraudulent and have been refunded permanently as their final decision) anyway when I receive the letter I contacted them and asked if that apply to other banks in general or just credit unions because I also had a dispute within n26  they assured me it Applies to all banks and urged me to message them and find out what the reasoning for not provisionally crediting my account was. So on their advice I did so. Instead of issuing a provisional credit they instead froze my account. Which made no difference because there were zero dollars in there. They informed me any funds that attempted to go in would be rejected. Imagine my surprise when they accepted  $52 deposited from Poshmark for a sale and $102 from wayfair. So now in total they have $160 of my money and refuse to transfere it to my credit union or to my ex wife’s N26 account. It’s been 3 weeks and i msg them every day and every day they hang up on me and provide me with no information. Like if my account is frozen and I cannot withdrawal money and you say will not accept any into it then do, is that not tantamount to theft? I have screenshots of every conversation I’ve had with them and am at my wits end. To the point I’m tempted to say screw the dispute because I need my $160 but the one charge is from an out of the us gambling set up(I don’t gamble my sons meds cost way to much and the new steroid is not yet made in generic so it’s out of pocket every month) they should have never processed a $500 ach to a bookie anyway what are they thinking. I’ve never spent over $150 on anything. So red flags should have shot up when $500 was ach debited by Skillz Sports. I’m at a loss and I’m in dire need of my money that they stole by accepting. After telling me they would refuse. I’m tempted to allow my school refund to go in there in 11 days and then contact my federal appointed loan handler and tell them I’m being refused my refund by the bank it was deposited in....

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-08-06T17:07:25.000Z,Do not open an account with them choose another bank,"Like most people I opened an account with n26 looking for a positive experience with a bank. I simply utilize the card no extravagant purchases simply normal small purchases and they froze my account under review status her unusual activity although there was no unusual activity. Every time I reached out to them they gave me the same cut and paste message, very callous uncaring. I have a infant daughter and they have Frozen my ability to be able to access my account and take care of her and buy things that are necessary. They don't care if I have an emergency. They have not reached out to me to confirm or deny any of my transactions. So how can you determine whether or not there is fraudulent activity if you do not reach out to the account holder? It has been an entire week during a pandemic that they have held my money without cause. I feel defeated I feel bullied and I feel robbed. Do not trust this Bank. Do not put the bulk of anything you actually need access to in an account with them. They only have chat customer service and that chat customer service will continue to cut and paste messages. Very horrible experience not a good thing you do not bank with them unless you like someone stealing your money under the guise of an account review.","Hey Lina,,We apologise for the negative experience you encountered with us. ,Could you please contact us via our Twitter @N26_Support or Facebook @N26 and provide us with the following code 70004. ,We would need to take a closer look at your file so we can discuss this further with you.,Best Regards, ,Kim, ,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5f2c38c795090032fd79dcb8,1,US

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2020-08-04T20:31:10.000Z,unnecessary complicated ID verification process,"I was a satisfied n26 user for 2 years. I was also recommending it to my friends and family. My mom is an older lady and very old school; she doesn't trust online banks. I finally convinced her to open an account and today she had identity verification. The agent was speaking fast and she said she understand german but not so fast, and she asked him to please speak more slowly. He said that he will not speak slow and if she doesn't understand what he is saying she can't open an account and then hung up. She has b1 level and has no problem to to everyday stuff in german; to see a doctor or to have a job interview. When she first arrived to Germany she didn't speak 2 words of german but she managed to open an account in Post bank. Perfect german is not on the list of requirements and I have no idea why it's been reinforced. Why this makes me so sad is because that agent crushed her confidence in a few seconds. And also her willingness to try something new. You have to understand there's a big age gap and she is not tech savvy. I had to write down her phone number and email, this is how older generation funktion. I also have an account with Revolut and I helped her to open an account in 5 Minutes. They only asked a photo of ID and a selfie, that's it. I would like to encourage n26 to check their agents who are dealing with ID verification, I'm sure my mom is not the only one.","Hey Selma,,Thank you for getting in touch!,First of all, sorry to hear your mother had a negative experience.

They talk nonsense on copy paste.,I just went through the most frustrating process of ID verification. They just do not know what they're doing!,Since N26 is a german bank, I thought they have an idea of what a valid residence permit look like. It can be in card form or the paper form that you stick in your Passport. I have a paper residence permit. ,IDnow agent said she can't accept mine because it only has 1 page, she said a valid one should have 2 pages. Which is stupid. And then she just hung up on me. How charming.,I then went to chat agent, first one said it's because they only accept the card version. And I asked him to get me a German agent.,The German guy asked if my visa permanent. I said no, it's valid for 3 years. And he said that's why, they only accept permanent residence. Which is bull, because many of my friends use N26 and they have even shorter permit.,They seriously have to educate themselves.,And I tried one more time, I went to chat, and again the agent said only card visa is valid. I asked him, where does it say that? He can't answer me.,then I try the video call again, and the agent said my residence permit is not on their ""database"" so she needs another form of ID and she asked for a student visa. I'm not a student anymore and I have working visa now. And when I said that, she hung up on me abruptly. Charming.,That's it for me then. I asked a chat agent to erase my data and I would never gonna suggest anyone to use N26.

Just at the first time i did not receive my Debid card it was lost. and i get easily support. Shipping can be faster. Just the negative point is: i have a mastercard and debidcard as a single card. The problem is,when a shop/cafeteria/restaurant does not have the machine wich suitable for the Creditcard, cannot be paid with the card. This point i donnot understand.But it is rarely happens to find in a shopping center/ restaurant/cafe without creditcard suitable devices...It would be nice to use the card as a Creditcard and at the same time as a Debitcard everywhere (i mean even old diveces). I havent tried it in abroad yet,but hopefully it works also in other countries.,Since a year i have an account in N26 i did not have any other or big problems. İt is fast and easy.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-07-14T11:26:09.000Z,False Claims for marketing purposes......,"Unfortunately although the account is easy to set up and use, I can't give it any more than a 1 star rating.  I purposely set up the account to be able to utilise direct debits and fast transfers free of charge, both of which were advertised on their website as a benefit.  Once the account was set up, it was clear that both of these claims were incorrect.  After setting up a number of direct debits with a number of different merchants in Italy, all failed to be set up correctly until N26 finally admitted after many calls that it was not possible at this time to set up direct debits in Italy.  I had a similar experience when trying to instigate an instant or fast transfer for a purchase, again as advertised on their website - when it came to it, the bonifico / transfer took a day and a half to come through to the receiving company and when I asked, they couldn't even give me a formal note or evidence of the transaction beforehand.  So all in all, if you want very basic functionality, then the account is fine.  But they clearly make a lot of promises before you open the account which they can't actually follow up on.  When I raised these concerns as a complaint via their support service, the very helpful advice provided was on how to close my account it was no longer needed - great customer service.......","Hey Paul,,Thank you for getting in touch!,First of all, sorry to hear you have had a negative experience, we would like to help rectify this for you. ,We support SEPA transfers, a direct debit failure happens when the merchant in particular relies exclusively on the SEDA channel (and not SEPA) to which N26 is not currently registered. We are currently looking into this but have no information to share at this time. We will remain transparent and update our customer's accordingly should any new features become available.,All domestic and international incoming SEPA transfers are instant if they come from a bank that supports instant transfers and the sender selects this option. In cases where the sending bank doesn’t offer instant transfers or the sender doesn’t choose this option, the transfer will be completed within one banking day. However, due to the opening times of the participating banks, one banking day may stretch to two working days. Outgoing SEPA transfers are completed within one banking day. You are able to send money instantly between N26 accounts with Moneybeam.,If you would like to discuss this further we would be happy to help.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-07-09T17:23:37.000Z,SCAM ALERT!! ~ NIGHTMARE ~,"SCAM ALERT!!! ~ NIGHTMARE ~,I mentioned to them that I would post an unfavorable review due to their lack of professionalism.,** To start with, N26 promotes to be offering a prime world-class card service, and it's not even close. A prime world-class bank company should offer a 24 hours of customer service, for their nowadays WORLD-TRAVELER customers, shouldn't they? Not to mention that we talk about financial services for travelers. Well, not in this case, in spite of the monthly fee charges, N26 people will only work during German office hours (God knows what those hours are!) and only are to be contacted by email or by social platform chats, such as LinkedIn or this one!. There's no phone number where to call. The chat room of their app is never answered. Email replays take weeks or sometimes even months. ,That's enough to know of someone in whom you trust your money, or financial assistance when traveling abroad.,** N26 people will let you open an account and rush-deliver your selected brand-new card, EVEN WHEN they aware that you intend to use it for services THAT THEY DON'T OFFER.,** N26 won't tell you crystal clear that they don't offer regular bank card services, even though they claim to offer a prime world-class card service. So, you'll only know after signing a contract.,** N26 won't tell you crystal clear that they only offer insurance services FOR TRAVELING purposes, and ONLY for selected countries in the world. Or they have it written in a super small letter and hard to decipher it, even though it is a fundamental clause of their policy.,** After you open an account with N26, you WON'T BE ALLOWED to close it at need (in my case, due to it'll be unuseful to me because I travel for work). So, you'll be forced to pay the maintenance fee for an entire year, until the contract year is due. Be sure that world-class financial services will let you close your account at any given time with no additional fees. Because they don't live up on that. N26 does., **In this case, N26 won't either allow you to downgrade to the free membership card (transparent) once you signed for a higher membership. Be sure that world-class black card services have NO problem accommodating your membership to your needs. ,** Be sure that N26 people will give you a terribly hard time closing your account with uncountable justifications, after the year contract is due, while they'll keep deducting the monthly maintenance fee. N26 people won't answer your emails and/or pretend that they'are unaware of your correspondence when they do answer. Although, be prepared to explain many times in different ways the same thing in many emails because it apparently always replies to you a different signing person.,** Finally, after many months of negotiations where you'll be asked to send additional documentation, you'll get notified by email about the closure of your account. In a world-class financial service, this simple fact would mean the end and final say of membership, but it will not mean the same for the N26 people. It means that you'll now receive further uncomfortable correspondence with inaccurate information about the status of your account and that of course, you now own them some money because either such account never REALLY close, or they're not aware that they formally closed it before.,This means, that even though your account was formally closed, they'll still contact you with inaccurate information, for years later.,*** So why contracting any service with N26? Please research more if you think doing it.","Hey,,Thanks for taking the time to leave your review.

The app never asked for Verification ID and just stated that I can't open an account, with no further explanation. With a message to contact support, with no link to support available. Support can be accessed only through an app that doesn't allow me to log in. In another review on Google Play, the support team simply replied with a link to an unhelpful documentation page.,I doubt the support even bothered to read the review.,There is no way to reach them to get an explanation.,Edit after N26s reply:,Basically what you're saying that when I was registered and provided my name, you have rejected my account based on my last name. According to your documentation, I'm a resident of a country that you allow to have an account. ,What I'm saying is that your application is bad, it didn't allow me to add any documentation and rejected me by my name","Hi Nastia,,As a regulated mobile bank, we are obliged to securely verify the identity of all potential customers. It is necessary to hold one of our currently supported documents to verify your account, which can be viewed through the link you have mentioned: https://support.n26.com/en-eu/account-and-personal-details/verifying-identity/how-to-prove-my-identity,If you cannot see the document corresponding to the nationality you have signed up with on that list, then it would mean we are unable to verify your account at this moment in time, however we are always working hard to add new supported documents to this list, so we hope to be able to onboard you in future.,If you do have a document mentioned on our list, you can open a live chat using the link attached to this message.

To have a specific look into your case, we would need you to contact us so we can identify your account. We can be reached on Twitter over at @N26_Support, or on Facebook.,We have no visibility on incoming transfers, which was why the information you received may have seemed vague. If you have any concern about a transfer you made to your N26 account, you would need to contact the sending bank for further information. In the case we were the sending institution, we would be able to advise further, but we cannot do so as the recipient.,Please note that we only accept incoming SEPA transfers in Euro. We accept SEPA instant for incoming transfers, but only if the sending bank also supports this. If SEPA instant is not used, then the transfer will take 1 banking day, which can stretch to 2 days, depending on when the transfer is made. The weekend is excluded in this, so a transfer made on Friday but not via SEPA instant would arrive on Monday.,Best Regards,,Lucy, Your N26 Support Team",/users/5c19e1286598710e2b2b4ae2,3,FR

So I had to block my Account. After 3mins with the support Chat I had it fixed, N26 blocked my account for safety of my Money and send me a new CreditCard wich will arrive in few days.,Even as I Told the support before blocking my account I have to withdraw money for my groceries he told that would be total OK, I should just hurry up, come back to chat after withdrawal and then he will continue the process. ,The support is very dedicated in Customers Service, allways friendly and helpful - not to mention that they exactly now what they do. ,From checking my Personal information to avoid someone wrong cheating with them, to anything inside the app or international questions.,Last but not Least - Cash26,Cash26 allows me to withdraw money from shops like Rossman, DM Drogerie, or even at gas stations like OMV for free. So I don't allways have to run for an ATM, wich could be a long way, instead the N26APP will show me all possible ATMs and Cash26 providing Shops, and so I can decide where to go to withdraw my money.,Little thing here, Cash26 should work better on communicating this function to the Shops Workers, because sometimes they looked at me like I would try something illegal so if the Cashier don't knows Cash26 and hears it for the first time he will call the manager to take care of that process, that's totally ok they are just keeping themselfs safe from any scam. ,So I can recommend N26 to everyone, Seafarers, traveller, even if you are not leaving your country that much, the possibilities and the control that I have on my money trough N26 are insane.,Thanks for reading, hopefully I can help someone with my review here is my N26 promotional code if i helped you in choosing the right Financial Institute. kiriakok2011",,/users/5eedcefc63c0275aaa145fa9,1,DE

I paid my credit card bill with this card as a debit payment and money was taken out of my account immediately. The next week I got my direct deposit and my money is now gone because they are saying the credit card company did not take the money out until 4 days later. I explained to them that money was not available to me it was already on hold so it was not available to me to spend, but they said I did and I did not because it was not available at all. One rep told me that the credit card company had to release an authorization because they had both a hold and have collected the money. I got my credit card company on the line to speak with n26 via three way, because they(credit card co) said they dont work like that and had them talk to n26 then the story changed and I used the money because the bank left it in my available balance which is not true because you clearly see it was deducted twice from my account and the supervisor I spoke to named James told me to figure it out by doing the math, but could not go over anything in my account to prove what he was saying is true. My credit card company still on the line was also confused but his lack of knowledge. I then told James I wanted this escalated he said ok but could not give me a time frame on how long it would take for someone to contact me or give me any reference number for the call or anything. His response was I don't work in that department, Really! This banks customer service is not knowledgeable, has no clue on whats going on, and to top it off my money is missing and no one can explain where it is. Never had these issues with my traditional bank. I Do not recommend this bank to anyone if small questions stump them I can't imagine if I had a huge issue. I now have to take other measures to try to get my money from a bank that has no concern or regard for hard times or people.","Hey Tracie,,Thanks for taking the time to explain this to us, we're sorry to hear this. ,Could you please come and speak to us on our social channels, we have opened up case - 22312 for you. ,Please quote this when reaching out on Twitter @N26_Support or Facebook @N26.,Best Regards, ,Kim, ,N26 Support",/users/5ee371da207f325031733011,1,US

N26,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,2020-06-09T02:33:53.000Z,Excellent online bank,"Excellent online bank. I'm in Spain where there is no independent regulator and consequently the banks are uniformly awful, and I needed to find an alternative after the second Spanish bank in four years started introducing charges for it's no charges account - without telling me! I am retired, just have a pension and no mortgage or insurance needs, just money in, money out.  I was looking for free banking so moving to N26 was a no-brainer, because it gave me that, a Spanish euro account ,and at a stroke removed me from having to deal with the Spanish banking sector. I'm British and the customer service in English is really helpful. The app is very well put together, and easy to use, with lots of nice features like ""spaces"", being able to hide the figures on the screen, as well as getting a changing total as you scroll through transactions -  very clever stuff. What is really impressive though is the customer service. When I first tried to set the account up, I had, without realising it inadvertently gone into the bit for customers with a Spanish ID, so just could not get it to work with my passport. I eventually gave up and abandonded further attempts to set up an account, concluding, (incorrectly), that N26 didn't know what they were doing. Two days later I got a call from N26 customer service, from a guy who initially addressed me in Spanish and then switched to English - I have some Spanish but English is obviously easier. He explained what had gone wrong, fixed the error after asking me if I would like to register as a UK national, and I subsequently set up the account. I can think of few banks that would proactively get in touch in this way. Since then I have had two ocassions to need customer service help where the bot couldn't provide a solution and on both occasions it has been very straightforward getting hold of someone and them dealing with things promptly. There has just been one draw-back so far, and that is that I am unable to pay my Spanish tax bill from my N26 account as N26's licence does not cover this, but presumably will in time.",,/users/5edef503a3ef4da97d23ab20,5,ES

Noone could tell me why the freeze was placed or even what the exact 24 hour timeframe was. SO, I ended up no using the account for over 2 weeks. The first transaction went through successfully however the account was frozen at the same time. I've spoken with customer service who gives you all "" I don't know"" ""we don't have that information"" and was even disconnected from their chat in the middle of conversation 3 times. Noone can tell me why the account was frozen a second time, how long it will be frozen for, or even what prompted the freeze to take place. Common sense allowed me to decipher this. One thing is for sure, this place is horrible when it comes to customer service. They could care less about restricting any access to your money - which is also a means of survival. There is no mention of frequent account lock outs or freezes however I assure this doesn't with any other bank. I imagine all the people who have favorable experience with this institution keep small amounts of money in their account and probably don't have any heavy transaction traffic. I've looked into the financials of N26 and Axos and all other associated institutions, not really any impressive numbers which makes perfect sense. I have filed a complaint with the FDIC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and forwarded all chat transcripts, transaction statements and a very detailed description of the issue at hand. When a financial institution freezes your account and restricts access to your means of survival (Food, Housing, Utility Payments) for weeks without warning, explaination, or support mechanism for accessing funds to survive - that institution does NOT need to be in operation. This was part of the message I have conveyed to the agencies my complaint has been filed with. In conclusion, there are too many other places to deposit your money that are safer, more dependable, and definately possess a legitimate environment regarding customer service that N26 clearly is against. I just hope I am able to access my money without having to wait weeks if at all.","Hey Timothy, ,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review. ,We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this has caused you. ,In accordance with banking regulations, N26 must carry out regular routine checks on user accounts.

N26,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,2022-02-17T22:30:51.000Z,Spero sia un programmatore N26 a leggere (RISOLTO),"Spero sia un programmatore N26 a leggere. Questo problema sembra essere troppo tecnico da essere compreso dal loro supporto clienti. Il problema è che sia nella app che nel sito web appare un messaggio di errore ""Numero di codice fiscale non valido"" quando invece è stato inserito un codice perfettamente valido ma appartenente a quei codici attribuiti dall'Agenzia delle Entrate per risolvere i casi di omocodia. L'Agenzia delle Entrate infatti attribuisce in questi casi (circa 30 mila in Italia) un codice che ha in una o più posizioni una lettera invece di un numero. Quando quindi la app e il sito web vedono una lettera dove pensano (erroneamente) ci debba essere un numero, il messaggio di errore citato su blocca tutto. È un problema di programmazione basata su fondamenti errati che vi prego di risolvere, altrimenti è impossibile andare avanti con la registrazione visto che il codice fiscale è obbligatorio. La risposta più divertente che mi è stata data due volte in chat da N26 è di andare all'Agenzia delle Entrate e farmi cambiare il codice fiscale! Chiedo scusa per aver dato solo una stella.,AGGIORNAMENTO: N26 ha capito e risolto il problema. Lenti, ma vi dico bravi lo stesso.,I wish a N26 programmer can read this. This issue seems to be too technical to be understood by their customer service. The problem is, a ""Tax number is not valid"" error message is wrongly returned both on the app and the website if the input is a perfectly valid fiscal code issued by the Italian Tax Office to manage the cases of equality of the fiscal code (omocodia) between different people (about 30 thousands in Italy). These codes have one or more letters in place of numbers, so when the app and the website check for the validity of the code and find a letter instead of a number, the mentioned error message is returned. The Italian Fiscal Code is required when country of residence is Italy, so there is no way to go on with the registration. The most hilarious ""solution"" given online twice by two different reps was to go to the Italian Tax Office and have the code changed!

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2020-06-03T20:53:09.000Z,Perfect Bank,"They are perfect bank - too perfect. ,I had two cases with  N26. Once almighty greedy ebay.com overcharged me for selling the item (maybe I was wrong with this one, ebay did not changed experience for the better by pointing me to the support on facebook ;-) ) and neither n26.com was great help too. They assigned the agent on my case, many mails went back and forth, they were refusing to help me, they pointed that I should contact, but how can I involve ebay when they ignored me? As far as remember this dude pointed me to contact info at ebay dot com ;-)  Great help N26.com!  :) This time was similar to the first one. I had unauthorised charge from VietnamCupid (dating site), I was actually their member and I had paid couple of times for their services. Lost interest in them (good portion of woman there are cyber beggars (they are hungry, they lost their phone) and gold diggers) but I left possibility that I could maybe talk with some nice and interesting woman in future. Until ya sneaky Aussie guys hehe, charged me 36 or something EUR for Platinum service which I did not asked for at all. By the way, VietnamCupid keeps your CC info on the file, so if you ever get some unasked charge from them or by some criminal who exploited some 10 years software bug, you know - IT IS YOUR FAULT, not OURS :D  Never mind, back to N26.com. I complained to them about this, they say - sure we will look into your case and contact you. Ok. Week passed, no contact, I chatted with support, this time story changed. First they started that I need to block card (Beware of the cheap banks, they are giving blame on you - reorder card, not any talk how to reverse charge), this time I reacted angry, I said that last week I've heard another story. Oh, yes,  I have to fill claim  blabla, had to fill file complain. I lost interest, it is not worth my 36 EUR to have headache with this crappy bank. Had to find another ASAP. So summa summarum, it is up to you if you want very cheap convinent bank (like N26.com) , which is perfect until you have sort of problem. Or you pay say services of the real bank - average 40 EUR every year, who will listen your complains and act accordingly.  I think 40 EUR is nothing compared to your nerves in the long run. Imagine if some criminal pulls the file from crappy noName dating site with your CC and pulls 1000 EUR from your card, and what will happen if your bank is N26.com? Think twice :),EDIT:,""As both of your cases would have appeared to be merchants you had previously dealt with for authorised transactions, our chargeback team would request that you try your best to make contact with the involved merchant, as this would greatly assist us in the chargeback dispute process. "" ,Dear N26.com what to do when merchant simply ignores you? Multiple times in first case I told your agent that ebay is simply ignoring me in my complains, no reasonable human response, but your employee ignored me. He kept to script: Contact merchant. But if the merchant does not respond? What then? Well, er..uhm write them to (Agent digged the email on front of ebay page) info at ebay.com ? And then off course they do not respond.  Sorry dude, no help, you did not get reply from the merchant. At the end you give up. It is not worth your mental health these 50-60 EUR. Well, is that respect of customer?,Another epic treatment from N26.com support:,I went to pull some money from crappy Eastern European  bank in Xxxyz Crap Country, sure got receipt from ATM, no money, but they charged my account. Haha Fine. Went to bank, obviously they are used to this crap, they said oh, ""probably bank bills got mixed or something."" Yes fine, not my problem what we are going to do, I did not get money and you charged me for warm air.  Well contact your bank. Ok. Went to N26.com support, the support agent told me well contact the bank who owns the ATM. Fine, called bank on phone - they say: ""sure give me your number we will contact somebody in our claiming center or something,and call you back"" After 15 minutes they called back and told me I had to complain to my bank to solve the issue. Okkkk. Went again to chat with another agent who turned out he was capable dude (I think his name was Michael), he asked me for receipt from ATM, I send it, and explained him what was the issue, fine I was thinking they will fixed it. But wait, in day or two there is agent who wrote to me that there is unclear things about my claim and if I can repeat him exactly what happened? I asked him what was unclear in my claim, he continued with canned BS.  I am really tired with this..is this support?,You have to explain 3x times same thing? Kinda interrogation or what?

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-04-28T10:10:00.000Z,I couldn't get my money,"I used N26 for a period of three maybe a little bit more months. It was a really good user interface and other opportunities but I wanted to change my phone number, which I thought was lost. They asked verification again to do this. I did, Although all my information is legal and true, they didn't accept it. (Date: 20 March 2020),I know that my information is clear, true, and legal. That's why I tried the open my account. I asked them to create a new case and tried to solve this problem for 10-12 days. They didn't solve my problem.,They wrote to me that I had to fill in the cancellation document to send me my money. Then I sent an account cancellation document to send the remaining money to my account. (Date: 3 April 2020),5 days later (8 April 2020): Surprise! They said that more documents were needed: Send the scanned IBAN to confirm the process. Scanned IBAN? I didn't even understand. I sent my document again.,14 days later (22 April 2020): They sent a more descriptive mail, thank God! 14 days later. It could have been more. They need ""...a scanned copy (PDF) of an official account statement with IBAN related to another bank account..."" I sent it.,28 April 2020: Of course! I still haven't received an answer. Were you expecting something different?,I would like to thank N26 Customer Service for helping me with limited authority. They are great! Back Office Support? I don't want to talk about them.,If you are a corporate company you should never victimize your customers.

I was offered half the money I lost, pretty quickly (1 week after the problem emerged). I guess it's still better than traditional banks.,They acknowledged their initial mistake they tried to make up for it, which I respect. Thanks Sullivan for your help.,---,The app /tech is really nice but after that it's only problems after problems. The support staff is nice too, but most of the time not helpful. I lost 70 euros in bank fees after one of their employees misinformed me about my account ID's. A transfer was issued from another country and was rejected because they sent me the wrong account name.,After HOURS with the support, several lies from their side trying to cover their mistake they finally agreed that they made an error but are not willing to compensate, not even with a free month of service (which is around 10 euros).","Hey,,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.,First of all, sorry to hear you have had a negative experience, we would like to help rectify this for you.,We are more than happy to help you resolve any issue you may be experiencing and investigate this matter further for you.,Can you kindly contact us via our Twitter support @N26_Support, we are very active here and are happy to provide you with further advice.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2020-04-19T12:03:42.000Z,Going in circles,"Moved to Germany and needed a new bank to settle down properly. Heard a lot of good stuff regarding N26 -- it was easy to get and to operate, so I tried my luck. ,Everything went good until I had to confirm my identity. No problem with that, except the fact that I accidentally wrote my phone number wrong in the App. Informed the customer care agent that was verifying me of the phone number being wrong and she sent me a verification code needed to activate my account to the correct number. I thought everything was solved, but I couldn't log in to the app because the phone number was only corrected during the time of the identification. Was talking to the customer agents at several occasions and nobody seemed to understand my issue. I had to save all the conversations with the agents because I was just too tired to write it all over again because nobody at N26 understood what was going on. I think it took them 3 weeks to actually solve the issue. I couldn't be more clear with them but still, no help.,Their solution was that I had to wait for my card to arrive so I could activate it, which was what made me ever more mad because it seemed as if they don't understand how their own system works - you need to activate the App (and you can only do that by having the right phone number in the App so that they can send you the activation code) before being able to use the card (which I had to remind them myself when talking to them, still no help anywhere). ,Ultimately I just decided that it's not worth the time and I texted the agent on their site that I wish to remove my account. Had to of course explain my issue for the 3rd time. Was transferred to a higher ranking agent that helped me with that, which was great! Kudos for doing something. :),All of my friends are really enjoying N26, apparently it's easy to use. I know it was my mistake that I wrote the phone number wrong, but one could expect more understanding of how the company and its system works from their agents. ,Wouldn't recommend myself.,All best,,Tim C,PS: I am still sorry for being mad at your agent Joao.,Answer to your reply:,Thanks for telling me that now and not before. See that you inform your agents that this is possible to do as I don't really see it being my responsibility to know this. And if you bothered to read my review you would know that I am using another bank now.","Hi Tim,,We're sorry to learn that you have had such issues when trying to open your N26 account.,In the event your number is entered incorrectly at signup, we must wipe this application so that you can start afresh, as it's not possible to change any sensitive information before completing verification.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-04-16T19:51:53.000Z,A terrible experience so far and I find…,"-------Update Nr. 1-------, N26 team reply here says, "" if you have permanently moved from a supported country to a country in which we do not operate, your bank account must, therefore, be closed,"" however, it was not permanent, obviously. Nonetheless, even if it would have been, no one from the staff has ever bothered to ask me whether it was temporary or permanent! Was I informed about this back then? No, I was not. The email exchange, luckily confirms this. In addition, being that it was temporary, does that mean that the bank can reopen my account? Highly unlikely. ,The bank says ""If we have had no response for a prolonged period of time about the negative balance, we may then have to pass this on to a third party agency to collect these funds,"" yet, I have clearly asked the bank for instructions and alternatives back then, I have explained my situation, thus my question, was not the staff supposed and obligied to provide me with the information regarding the possibility to set up a repayment plan?,Still, I will wait for an official  response to my email regarding my request. I will update this till all this ends, no matter how long it takes. ,----------------------------------------------------------------,A terrible experience so far and I find it crucial to share it. ,Through the course of April and May 2019, I have had dozens of long calls and more than ten email exchanges with the staff at N26. In the end, after they were not able to resolve my issue and enable me to have access to my account, they terminated my account with the justification that ""you have moved from Germany to country X"". ,N26 closed my account just like that, out of nowhere, and at that point, I had a debt of 250 Euros (overdraft). I could not log in anymore in my account, and I could not generate QR codes to top-up my account. Being that my other bank account was located in a non-EU country and did not support SEPA and neither Transferwise nor Paypal, the transfer cost of 250 Euros to close my debt would cost around 30 Euro, so, Euro 250 (debt) plus Euro 30 (transfer fee) equals Euro 280. That was not something I was willing to do. I was never offered another alternative to paying back the debt, besides receiving two email reminders. NB! I was not informed about the possibility to set up a repayment plan to do that as soon as I had access to the EU banking system, as I do now.  ,Recently, I was contacted by a German debt collection agency, in German, a language that I do not speak nor understand, asking me to pay back around Euro 370. I will not negotiate with e debt collection agency as their claim is baseless, considering the responsibility that N26 had in the way they handled things (I have all the email and transcripts); thus, I contacted today through email N26 with a repayment plan proposal to repay my debt on May 25th, 2020, as like a said, now I have access again in the EU banking system, and I could sort it quickly. However, based on my previous experience with them, I do not think they will cooperate and neither provide an alternative. Remains to be seen and I will update this post as soon as I get an answer.","Hi,,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.,We regret to learn of this situation and apologise for any inconvenience caused. It is correct that if you have permanently moved from a supported country to a country in which we do not operate, your bank account must therefore be closed. If it is a temporary move for less than 18 months, the account can stay open.,In order for an account to be fully closed, the balance must be levelled to zero. If a balance stays in negative for an excessive amount of time, we will issue a number of reminders to the customer to bring the balance to zero. It is then the responsibility of that customer to then level their account balance through necessary means, so as to not incur any additional fees on the debt.,If we have had no response for a prolonged period of time about the negative balance, we may then have to pass this on to a third party agency to collect these funds. This must then be resolved directly with the agency.,Best Regards,,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5e989a58fa51175819597193,1,MT

Now for the Star reduction :D,If your transferring funds to another account, there are 2 ways. First is using the IBAN of the recipient (very easy and no problems when inside Europe), the other (for international transfers) is a 3rd Party provider (TransferWise). TransferWise is integrated into the N26 App but comes with limitations as well, that it limits the options, potentially forcing you to use their website. There is no option for a ""normal"" transfer (using the Name and bank account information of the recipient allowing for international transfers).

Beginning of March they said they needed to close my account in April due to Brexit. So I called them about what account I can move the funds to as they requested.  So I was going to move my funds that day for them.  However, I came off the phone to receive an email. Now telling me that my account was blocked.  Very coincidental.   They then sent me emails asking for a bank account in which to send the funds to.  So I did what they requested.  I have now sent 7 emails in total and left messages through trust pilot and twitter and they do not respond to emails full stop.  They say they have not received.  I have every delivery receipt as I have been in the IT & Computing industry for 25 years.   We all say the bank is great.  But you don’t realise until you have an issue that there is no support or replies when you need to get something done. They blocked my accounts and I have no access to my funds.  Be warned that if you have money with this bank you could be refused access to it without any explanation or response to your requests or emails.  There is no formal supports and the address they give backoffice. support @n26.com.  No one replies and stated in forums that they have not received your emails.  Even my legal representative has written via email to them.  We are now seeking legal advice for holding my funds when I have asked for it to be transferred under their instructions.

Small support cases are handled well via chat.,I like N26 and also recruit friends for this bank, because MoneyBeam alone has enormous advantages.

I tried another and the same thing happened.  This was on a Friday night.  They debited my account for it.,Their system of customer service does not let you call. Instead, you have to use an online chat system that logs you out if you are inactive, however, they constantly ask you to wait while they figure out the problem.  They will offer to call you but not specify a time except ""within the next several days from 7-11."" ,Once I finally did reach a customer service representative on the phone, we eventually worked out the atm issues.

Never keep money on the N26, you can wake up one day and not be there anymore. I bought a ticket on 01/20, traveled on 01/27, on 01/30 I was charged, complained, and they stopped responding to me, saying that a charge is normal 10 days later.","Hey Vinicius,,thank you for reaching out. Please be assured that your account and money is always safe with us, as the safety of our accounts is our highest priority. Please find our statement on security in the following link: https://n26.com/en-de/security,It seems that what you have experienced is the authorization of the amount by the merchant that you bought the ticket from. When you buy something online or offline with your card or your card details, not to be confused with your bank details such as your IBAN, the merchant first authorizes the amount before deducting it from your account. ,To authorize the amount means that the merchant reserves the amount for deduction before finally deducting it from your account. After the amount was authorized  the merchant has 12 days to deduct the amount from your account, otherwise the authorization will expire which mean the amount would have never left your account. ,Most of the merchants chose to deduct the amount which they have authorized on the same day the authorization happened, but some merchants take their time and deduct the amount a few days later, but as mentioned before not later than 12 days. This is the case that most likely happened to you. ,You can always check which amounts have already been deducted from your account and which ones were just authorized by downloading and checking your balance statement. All amounts listed there are the ones that have been deducted from your account or credit transfers your account has received. The authorized amounts which have not yet been deducted are only visible in your transactions list. ,You can easily download and check your balance statement by clicking on the three dots at the upper right corner of your app and selecting the option to download your balance statement. ,The authorization is a normal banking procedure offered by most credit card providers such as Mastercard. ,We are sorry if this caused any inconvenience for you. ,We gladly offer to take a look at your transaction and check what exactly has happened.

I was unable to open an account without any reason. Robotic agents kept saying “we can’t open an account and won’t provide you any further information”. I went online and left some negative reviews on this bank and got a response saying that I was unable to open an account because my identity can’t be verified. Why agents couldn’t tell me that at first place???? I got back to customer service saying I’m ready to provide any information to verify my identity and again I got the same automated response “we can’t open an account and won’t give you any further information”. This is outrageous. Of course you can’t verify my identity by just asking my name and date of birth! All online banks in the US ask for photos of IDs, social, selfie etc to verify identity. Why can’t you? Absolutely terrible.","Hey Anton,,Thank you for your interest in opening an account with N26. We’re sorry if we are unable to offer you an account.

He lost 2000 euros as a result. N26 lied to us, and said that Mastercard had made the decision not to refund the funds back to his account. We followed this up with Mastercard, who confirmed it was in fact N26 who made the decision.,For 6 weeks, we have been trying to get help via N26's support and complaints department, but they will not help us. They have said that the decision has been finalised, there are no extra steps to help us.,We have repeatedly requested that they assist us to get CCTV from the time of the withdrawal to prove that my boyfriend did not access these funds. We have also referenced N26 terms and conditions that state that they will refund funds lost due to ATM fraud, and they have now simply stopped replying. Out of everyone we spoke to from N26's support and complaints department, not one member of staff offered any words of sympathy or acknowledgement for the hellish experience my boyfriend is going through. Very poor customer service indeed.,I have spoken to several other N26 customers that have also lost funds due to the actions of N26. These customers were only able to get their funds back through lengthy EC dispute resolution processes. It has become painfully clear that N26 do not care about customers and their money, their inexperienced staff only care about closing tickets, and they will simply ignore any messages containing evidence relating to serious fraud. There's nowhere you can visit in person, there is no number you can call - as a customer, you are completely powerless in this situation. ,Alternative reviews you might read about N26 simply relate to customers who have never had any issues or lost any money, but that is a very precarious position to be in as a customer. Think carefully about whether you want to take that risk when you are selecting a bank. Better to go with a bank that will actually help you when things go wrong.","Hi Genevieve,,We regret to learn of this situation.,In the event you have experienced card fraud on your N26 account, our dedicated chargeback team will open a dispute with MasterCard once they have been alerted to the issue. ,They will then investigate the case thoroughly in accordance with MasterCard Terms & Conditions.

Where else do you get that? I am super pleased with their services, and never had any issues since I started to use them. And what I like the most: they are completely free of charge. The ING charges 1.25 euro per month just for holding a bank card. That's kinda lame if you ask me. The only thing I'm missing is to pay online with IDEAL with N26, but I've heard rumours they are planning to introduce this as well. The minute N26 offers the possibility to pay with IDEAL, I will be closing down my account at ING. ,Keep up the great job you're doing N26, greeting from a very happy customer. :))",,/users/5e34349bddcefae03862c602,6,NL

Sadly at this point I'm now in the lengthy process of going through the Financial Ombudsman Service and HM Courts.,If only I could go back and never of signed up for this bank. If you want a bank that will freeze and take your money without explanation and then have no contact number or branch, maybe it's for you.

I'm currently speaking to a few media companies and updating them on the case. Stick with a high street bank, where you can talk to someone and resolve issues.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-01-23T15:23:14.000Z,Fraudulent Bank,Last week after looking at my deposits and withdrawals I noticed $116.71 was missing from my account due to bank error  ... I used the chat feature on the app and explained the situation ... the chat representative basically refused to help... a contacted the bank again through the chat feature told the representative my issue and he provided me with the customer service phone number. I called in and told them the issue. The representative opened a ticket and told me it would be 3 business days for someone to get back to me ... I called again the next day to get an update and was hung up on by a supervisor. I called back again the representative Dondre stated he could see the bank error with my balance and he would work to get the ticket expedited to get my money back to me. Of course I didn’t receive a call or email so I’ve been calling repeatedly.. I have been hung on numerous times and treated in despicable manner. I only want MY money back that’s all. This is the bank’s mistake and I should not have to beg to get my money back. This is my money that I worked for and entrusted to this bank and they have taken advantage of me. Please beware of this bank and their practices before doing business with them. I would hate for another customer to go through  what I’m going through with them. It’s horrible to do this .... the bank just takes your money and refuses to give it back !!!,,/users/5e29ba44ddcefa4b095d4e99,1,US

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2019-12-24T15:29:10.000Z,Beware - not everyone can make online payments!!! Poor customer support.,"N26 is a great bank, IF you DON'T have to contact customer service. ,Now you may think, ""Hey if everything they offer works, then there should be no problem. Meaning if I can pull my money and make purchase with my card. Perfect!"",And THAT'S the problem. The very foundational core features of any bank, is being able to:, ,1 deposit money ,2 withdrawal money ,3 and make purchases (this is the problem),However, with N26, you can't always make purchases. ,They have a problem with making online transactions using 3DS (secure online payment service), which forces you to login via the N26 app, and approve the online transaction you are trying to buy.,However, the app always gives me an error saying, ""Error: No internet connection"", after I login to the app and try to approve the purchase.,Clearly, I have do an internet connection, as I have to login first to the app.   ,This has been going on for a YEAR now. And yes, I've always made sure, I have the latest version of the app, deleted the app, and re-installed the app countless time, made sure I've enable all push notifications. ,I've tried getting a new card shipped to me, the app kept on giving me errors while trying to complete the process, charges me twice for the new card, and after 1 month, the card still hasn't arrived (even though they say it only takes 10 business days),Now you might think, I'm just a rare case. I called my one friend who also has n26 (lives in a different country) as well, and he told me he has the same exactly problem. (and no one has been able to help him either),Now, here is the REAL problem, not one N26 Customer Service rep, has any idea that this problem exists, and they give me the same go around (""do you have the latest version of the app etc.. etc.."") and they keep telling me to email in a support ticket. Which I have, several times, and all I get is a response, that someone will reach out to me in 7 business, and it's been MONTHS and still not a world on how to resolve this issue.  Heck, I can't even get a new card shipped to me. ,And this is the crazy part, I'm paying THEM money, for something they claim, they save you money on! Which is making purchases with no FX charges - and I can't! ,I'm actually losing money as I have to wire money out of my n26 account into another account so I can make a online purchases.,I can't even make a fundamental transaction online, and they are claiming to be a modern high tech fin ""bank"", and, in Germany of all countries. Yet, no refunds, no reply from customer support, I can't get even order a new card. Very unprofessional!!! ,Just a tip N26, maybe stop scaling your user base, if you can't keep up with the customer support? There should be bank regulations for this. ,It's been 1 year, I've been potential enough.","Hi Pablo. Thanks for the feedback.  Can we ask if you are running the latest version of the app?

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-12-20T01:36:47.000Z,Why I left N26 - PART III - How did this all end ?,"Why I left N26 - PART III - How did this all end ?,After I understood that customer service wouldn’t help me, I decided to try something by myself. I connected an old account (which country was set to France) to try and download the app. It didn’t work. I then tried searching for the app in the playstore on some Japanese friend of mine’s phone. It worked. That’s how I realised the problem wasn’t about the country, but about my Android version. I was wrong the whole time. And the most amazing thing is that the customer service was never able to tell me that the app had been recently restricted to Android 6.0 and later, not even the one who asked me about my phone version and to whom I clearly stated that my Android version was 5.0.,The customer service of N26 is awful. Their staff are not trained at all. They don’t know the very basics of how to use the app, which is a crucial part of online banking. N26 doesn’t give a crap about it’s customers.,Anyway, a few days later I received a nice email from them telling me I had violated their terms of use and my account would be closed a month later.,I contacted the customer service to explain to them I was in Japan for only a year and I had just come back to France. I showed them my Japanese resident card, with the expiry date, but they replied it wasn’t an acceptable document; only an electricity bill (or something similar) with my name on it would be accepted. But I am now staying at my parents place and have no bill with my name on it.,I found it amazing that they didn’t need a proof of me living outside of the EU to close my account, but they needed one to prove I’m living in the EU in order to cancel the account closure. Basically they need no proof to accuse a customer of violating their rules; but the customer has to provide proofs to prove he didn’t. Super nice.,I could have fought and argued about it with the customer client, but I decided that if it was all the respect they give their clients I didn’t need them anymore. So I let them close my account.,Now, in 2019 most people living abroad need to have a bank account in both the country they come from and the country they’re living in now. As a bank that boasts being modern and innovative, you would expect N26 to understand that. But apparently, they don’t. ,I would understand it if I needed a loan, since they would have trouble recovering it if I wasn’t paying and living outside of the EU. But that wasn’t the case; I had a regular bank account, which was blocked (meaning any payment that would put my balance below 0€ would be refused). So I really don’t see any valid reason for them forbidding their clients from living abroad.,After this problem, I started looking for another online bank. So I tried looking for “best online banks for European expats”. What made me cringe is that N26 appeared in almost all of them, even though they are literally forbidden to expats. And it’s actually the case for most online banks, so I realised people who write these kinds of tops have most of the time no idea what they’re taking about, and haven’t tried any of the banks they recommend.,SO IF YOU’RE A EUROPEAN EXPAT LOOKING FOR AN ONLINE BANK ACCOUNT, WATCH OUT. MOST OF THEM (INCLUDING N26) ARE HOSTILE TO PEOPLE LIVING OUTSITE OF THE EU. Now you can trick them into believing you still live in the EU by using your old phone number and giving them the address of your parents, but be aware that if anything happens and they discover it your bank account will be closed.,So what’s my online bank recommendation for EU expats ? ,After doing some very long and frustrating researches, I am now using Transferwise. It’s one of the only bank that will let you use a phone number from outside the EU and not require a proof of residence to open an account. I checked with them and living in Japan appears to be tolerated.,Other than that, the perks is that the card is totally free, and that it has a very useful that let’s you transfer money in many countries for the price of a local transfer, which is super convenient if you need to regularly transfer money from a country to another.,The downside is that all the currency conversions are subject to a 1% fee. It is pretty low, but still above the 0% that some other online banks might offer (usually for a paid card). So depending on how much money you want to transfer, TransferWise might be a good option.","Hi Pierre,,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.,We regret that this has been your experience with us, and we can understand your frustration. ,Your devices are most secure when they’re up to date.

If the merchant cannot accept this, we sadly have no influence over this. If the merchant can accept Mastercard and you experience some issues with the card, we encourage you to contact us via live chat so that we can investigate. If it is an issue with a contactless transaction you are having, we encourage you to try via Chip and PIN instead.,Any insurance package offered with one of our premium cards is provided by Allianz. We are not permitted to discuss any insurance specifics or advise on insurance matters as this needs to be handled by Allianz themselves, as they are the provider and outline the terms and conditions of the insurance, and in turn this insurance is one of the benefits of the N26 Mastercard.

Have not been helpful in getting the money back.,"Hi Denise,,We're sorry to learn that you've experienced an issue retrieving some funds.,Security is a huge priority for us at N26. When an account application is made, every single user must undergo strict verification in which they provide us their details, and must present us with their valid passport/ID card so that we can review this and open their account provided there are no discrepancies. ,We recommend that all users remain vigilant with who they send funds to. It is paramount that you only ever transfers funds to an account of a person you know, as it can be difficult to retrieve bank transfers as they must be authorised by the customer themselves within the app. If you have sent funds to an N26 account from another account, it is necessary to contact the sending bank so that they can initiate an official Payment Investigation to track the funds. We can also initiate Payment Investigations, but only if the funds were sent from your N26 account.,Best Regards,,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5da9c2134ee2a966d551bfa2,7,GB

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2022-01-03T18:27:46.000Z,Terrible in so many ways,"Get ready, because this is going to be one of those long reviews you won't forget.,Terrible in so many ways. Here are just a few things that happened to me during my time with N26:,- I have been abroad to several countries (USA, South Africa, etc) and none of my N26 cards worked -- I was sometimes able to withdraw cash, but most most of the time it was impossible. Things work fine as long as you stay in the EU (including Iceland, Switzerland etc) but do NOT rely on N26 when travelling abroad. Funny enough, a woman at the JFK airport told me that she sees a lot of people with ""transparent cards"" (the debit card of N26 is transparent and very easy to recognize) having problems paying for train tickets or get cash at the airport.,- No support, no support, no support. Nothing feels worse than being in a foreign country with no cash, cards that don't work and no support to call because it's 11pm in Germany or it's Sunday or whatever. Again, do NOT use N26 when you go abroad. Definitely open an account with a proper bank that has a trustworthy history and that will give you cards that are guaranteed to work all over the world. And a bank you can call 24/7, too.,- I was once locked out of my account for an ""indefinite"" amount of time because the phone number I'd used to register to N26 used to belong to another person before me. Again, calling N26 was useless and I had to find this person myself (who thank god used to work at my company) and ask them to unlink their old phone number to their N26 account. During that time I was unable to withdraw cash or access my account on the app.,- My money once disappeared temporarily just to come back a day later or so. Customer support apologized and said that a ""bug"" was preventing me to see how much money I had in my savings.,- The app has a TON of bugs, some of them have been there for years now. Like the savings/investments section is totally messed up, the numbers didn't even add up (like 1000€ and 15€ of interests would give a sum of 1010.97€ or some other random numbers unrelated to tax deductions or anything). On top of the usual glitches you have to get used to, I remember there was a time when the app was just crashing on startup but that got fixed fast thankfully,- update from 03.01.2022: I have moved out of Berlin but N26 is still causing problems. My landlord in Berlin tried (wrongly) to charge me for January's rent. I got a message in the morning from N26 saying that a direct debit was coming from the landlord at 6pm and that I didn't have sufficient funds to cover the rent, because I have since moved my money to another bank. I immediately contacted N26 asking them to block the direct debit from the landlord, and I also informed the landlord of their mistake. Long story short: N26 gave me a form to fill out in order to block the direct debit, and I immediately filled it out and sent it back (this was early in the morning). Of course, N26 notifies you of a direct debit less than 24 hours before it happens, but they take up to 3 days to process the requests to block direct debits. So there's that. Meanwhile the landlord had entered my direct debit in the system, and they couldn't cancel it, so they agreed to refund me in case it was deducted successfully. Eventually, the direct debit came because N26 didn't block it, but I was charged 3€ because that's what happens when someone tries to charge you and you have no money on your account. I immediately talked to customer support and talked to Charikleia (who told me I can use their name for my trustpilot review), asking if I could be refunded the 3€ fee which *was a charge beyond my control*. I explained that I did everything in my power to notify N26 and block the upcoming direct debit, but because of N26's failure to react quickly to its customers' requests, they didn't block it and I was unfairly charged. The support agent was not helpful at all, and they ""explained"" that those ""fees cannot be refunded because they are automatic"", something that is obviously untrue and fails to explain what I should have done in order to prevent the fee. So apparently N26 warns you of the fact that you might incur into a fee, but when you tell them to BLOCK the payment that causes the fee, they don't do it. So in the end they happily charge you.","Hi Omar,,We regret to learn of the issues you had during your time with N26.,Your N26 Mastercard can be used worldwide with any merchant that has the capability to accept Mastercard.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2020-01-08T15:28:19.000Z,Think twice,"No doubt, they will answer and pretend that they are approachable and can sort any problem as their customer service is very good, in fact they are quicker to respond on here than for their own support but…,I’ve taken an N26 ‘You’ card and membership. When I received the mail saying my card was on its way, on the mail it said “Follow your wanderlust Relax: your trip is covered if you’re sick and can’t make it. And with free foreign ATM withdrawals and foreign medical coverage, based on the Insurance General Terms and Conditions, you can go wherever your heart takes you.”,I could not find any details of what was covered with that insurance when I logged into the app.  I ‘spoke’ to customer services who said they would look into it as this insurance only relates to the ‘Metal’ account. That’s when I realise that they obviously made a mistake, but as I pointed out to them it is a rather BIG mistake. How many other similar emails have they sent out and how many have been misled like me? Customer service just casually dismissed it and said we can swap you to a Metal account (an assurance for £120 extra a year on top of the £4.90/month. Hmmm let me think!) As they are a financial institution you‘d think that, one, such a mistake would be impossible and 2 they would be equipped to deal with this efficiently and swiftly.  What else have they told me wrong about this account? This is worthy of trading standards getting involved. They have a flat hierarchy apparently (the joy of new business start-ups, who don’t want to pay their staff very much and say no managers, you are all important), so when they said the case had been escalated I don’t know where, Germany? May be they need a serious manager that can actually take important decisions. Debiting the membership fee was the only thing efficient and swift about N26. I was casually brushed aside, they said that ‘as a gesture of good will’ (which mean I could not care less, take those crumbs and go away) they would reimburse my first £4.90. I have since as it is my right (within 30 days) cancelled my account all together. What would I have done better in their shoes, admitted my mistake (they did) admitted that it was a major issue (they did not) offered the insurance for a year as promised in the email (that is not a gesture of good will, it is what they have to do since THEY told me I had insurance, I did not make it up). I’ve been advised to go with N26 by a friend who never had issues with them. I think this is the main thing as always, if you have problems on your account, everything goes well, if you have the tiniest issue then they let themselves down very badly. How long can you keep your fingers crossed that nothing goes wrong with them? I’ve since done some research online and realised that there are banks around that offer same/better deals with no fees. Their product is not unique and their approach to customer services really does not make them stand out, shop around!!!  Anyone is allowed a mistake but what sorts the great from the weak is the way you handle your mistakes. I do not put feedback lightly on anything but I feel strongly about this and I hope this will help people in thinking twice. ,*** You already know what happened I've sent you 3 detailed emails about it in the last 2 weeks. Got answers from Dylan Jessica..... You have just chosen to ignore the problem that's why I cancelled the account. ***,***They pretended they cared (as they do every time on trust pilot). I sent them all the details again as requested but after 4 days still nothing. I rest my case ***,***once again. Nice little touched to say they ve looked into it and it won't happen again.

If you wish to close the account, the fees would first need to be paid.,If you notice a transaction that was not made by you, we can initiate a Mastercard chargeback dispute to claim these funds back: https://support.n26.com/en-eu/fixing-an-issue/fees/how-to-dispute-a-transaction,If the charge is linked to a bank transfer, we can initiate a Payment Investigation, however bank transfers need to initially be confirmed from directly within the paired device.,Bank transfers made via SEPA take 1 banking day to appear on your balance. This can stretch to 2 banking days, depending on when the transfer was initiated. If you are awaiting a transfer into your account and it is taking longer than this, it's important to reach out to the sending institution, as under SEPA regulations it should not take longer than 2 banking days. ,We look forward to implementing SEPA instant in future.,Best Regards, ,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5dcbedd39101137d5cefed70,1,NL

(i.e. additional fees),2) They lower your balance based on invisible transactions, today I literally found my balance to be 30 Euros less than it should be and I reviewed all my transactions, I didn't miss a single one, that money was literally stolen by N26.,I will use this card less from now on.","Hi Vittorio,,Thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback.,We do not charge any additional fees to your transactions after they have been made, and we also do not charge a fee on any POS transaction in any currency. Sometimes in your mobile app, you will see a small blue dot next to a transaction - this will notify you that your transaction is subject to a small change as the transaction is settled. This would usually happen if a transaction is made in another currency than that of your account. ,When you make a purchase with your N26 card, it can take a short while for the merchant to collect the transaction - this happens with any bank. So you may make a transaction, but the funds will be reserved in your account for a few days until the merchant actually debits them. This is why you may see a transaction appear twice, if a number of days pass between the transaction being initiated and then cleared, although only one amount will debit.,You can always reach out to us via live chat and we will be more than happy to go through your transaction history with you. You can also view your balance statements in PDF format at any time within your mobile app or web app. On the web app, just login to https://app.n26.com/login and select the icon to the left of the ""+"" symbol.,Best,,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5dbc310996632f1d8ae18bd7,8,RO

I'm fairly certain everyone is dropping their account and they are going under because their customer service is appalling. ,I've waited almost a week for a ""phone specialist"" to call me. Chased them up daily as soon as the online chat opened EU time. Was promised a call within 24 hours every time, but never did. I decided to just send the letter to close the account, and let that happen whenever someone at N26 decided to do some work. Funnily enough, then got a call at midnight, Australian time but there's just silence on their end! So since I'm half asleep I hang up. Got back on the chat, because how can I sleep now? And what do you know? Back to square one. Set up a new call with a new code and wait next to my phone 24 hours a day for God knows how long.,Edit to respond to N26 reply. They were made aware of my time zone from the first contact, when I expressed concern about what time I would be called ""within a 24 hour period"". When I was not called after 3 days I would have accepted a call at any time of day. When I finally spoke to a human being after 7 days, at 3am my time, I almost laughed out loud when they asked if I wanted them to call back at a better time. ,I also made an effort to access the chat daily at 5pm Aus Time, which is when business starts at N26, 7am EU time. So they had an entire business day, in their time zone, to call me. It still took 7 days and me telling them I wanted to close my account. Also, their system doesn't let them call while I'm on the chat. So my choice is waiting in radio silence for a call that will never come, or trying to get information and further delaying my call.","Hi Phoebe,,Firstly we regret that you were put in such situation.

I contacted them again. ,They told me I needed to go to an ATM and withdraw money and return to them within 24 hours so they can schedule a new call. ,I didn't get the first call. I'm certain. I have never actually hated a company before. ,Oh, and when I asked to contact someone else, all I could get was the complaints email address. There is no way to talk to anyone higher up than the chat support people.,********,I have been trying to regain access to my account for almost a month now. The hoops they have you jump through in order to identify yourself would be laughable if it wasn't so enraging. ,You have to talk to them in the chat; and then go to an ATM and withdraw money (which incurs fees where I live now); and then come back to them and talk to them again within 24 hours. I received each step of that process in a different conversation with them. No one told me as I wrote it here. It was ""go to an ATM."" Then, after I did ""No you have to tell us within 24 hours of the withdrawal."" Okay, did that. ""No, you have to have talked to us within 24 hours so we know it's you."" ,Then, once you finally get through that, they want to give you a ""confirmation callback"" with a special access code they gave you in the chat. This amazing system is that they will ""call you within 24 hours"",Within 24 hours. ,Absolutely no way to get a smaller window. I don't know, maybe most of their clientele don't have jobs or lives or anything better to do with literally an entire calendar day, but having to wait by the phone for 24 hours really makes me angry. And if you miss the call? Well screw you you'll have to start all over again.,Not to mention that the reason for all the troubles is that I moved to a new country and my old phone number no longer works. So, now there's a 9 hour time difference but I have to get all of this done during their business hours. I'm not allowed to talk to the branch of the company that is in my current country. No, that would be too easy.,This is the absolute worst scam of a ""bank"" I've ever seen. I can't imagine how this is something that is really happening in this day and age. I cannot access my own money because they've held it hostage by their theatre of security. I don't feel secure, I feel insulted.,Because, you can give them all of your personal information; offer to send photos of your passport; recite every identifying factor of your person, and they still won't do a damn thing until you do their 48-hour dance of self-indulgence. It's absolutely disgraceful. ,Once I regain access and get my money out of their claws, I will be closing my account faster than you can say ""sorry, it's been 25 hours: start over again.""",,/users/5a672af00000ff000b04aa32,2,NL

We currently do not offer the service across all of our markets, but we hope to expand this in future. The feature is linked to the country in which your Terms and Conditions are based, which is the country in which you initially opened your account. In your case, this country would be Ireland, and CASH26 is currently not offered in this location, or for customers with Irish T&Cs. It is not possible to change the country in which your Terms & Conditions are based - it is only possible to change your legal address. It is currently possible to use CASH26 if you have opened an account in Germany, Austria or Italy. This is why you would have been advised that the best course of action would be to close your account, so that you could then open an account with Italian Terms and Conditions.,We understand this is not convenient as you have a premium N26 Metal account, which has a monthly fee associated with it. In accordance with the contract which is signed when opening a Metal account, if the request is made to close the account whilst in the contract, the agreed upon remaining fees are requested by us.,Again, we apologise for this experience and we hope that we can resolve this issue for you as soon as possible. Please feel free to reach out to our live chat, email or Twitter Support so we can help.,Best Regards,,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5daa22b21ce738349fe6b368,1,IT

The verification process is cumbersome and makes you go to an ATM to withdraw cash so they can verify your identity. Then you have to wait for a call (it can happen at anytime in 24 hours) to provide a code. If you miss the call (as I did), you have to start the whole process again, including going to the ATM again. Customer service is just terrible and not helpful at all. It was by far one of the worst experiences I had with a bank. Changing a phone number shouldn't require this much work to update the account. You are better off going for a traditional bank or using any other digital bank (Monzo, Revolut, etc).","Hi there, thanks for taking the time to let us know.

Really, really, really bad. I would avoid an account at this bank at all costs, the awful service and systems could leave you without access to your money. ,I changed my mobile number, and went through the authorisation process. This involves making an ATM withdrawal. After speaking to five agents on the online chat, finally the process was successful, and I was told I would get a call back within one hour to verify the code. After waiting for two hours, and because it was already past 1:00am, I contacted chat again. They apologised, and said I would be called the next day after 7:30am. Thirteen days later, I am still waiting for the call.  ,After three days, I emailed the customer service email, and was told that messages are currently being answered in seven days. Perhaps I was lucky, because I received a reply in six days, asking for a phone bill with my name on it. I do not have a phone bill with my name on it, because my phone number is a pay-as-you go account, and is managed entirely online. I replied with this information two days ago, and have heard nothing. ,My salary within Germany is paid into this account, and all my payments are made online from it, including rent, phone bill, Rund­funk­beitrag (TV license). This means I can not currently make any payments online. I can withdraw cash, but of course N26 charges for cash withdrawals and deposits over a certain limit. I also have no way to check my balance. I usually have €1000 - €2000 in the account, not a huge amount, but significant, and as these are my only funds in Germany, the inconvenience is extremely significant. ,I have even asked to close the account. Guess what? I can't even close the account with my mobile number being authorised. Go back to square one, and repeat ad infinitum. ,I will be complaining to the German financial regulator. I have never dealt with any organisation which provides such an important service and which is so careless, uninterested, and so basically incompetent. Added to which, most of the agents were at least polite, but one was extremely rude. ,If just one person reading this changes their mind about opening an N26 account, I will have saved someone from a huge amount of trouble.

Right now, for example, I have to ""pair"" my brand-new smartphone with my account because for certain transactions, such as payments to another bank account, you cannot use only the web app, as is the case with every other bank where I have account, but you also have to go on N26's smartphone app and ""confirm"" the transaction. The problem? Although I've done everything I'm supposed to do, the N26 Android app REFUSES to ""pair"" my smartphone with my account. I have an important payment of nearly 800 euros I need to send no later than today, but I'm blocked from ""confirming"" it. I could tell more horror stories, as my wife also has struggled mightily with N26 and their obviously deeply flawed smartphone app, but I'll leave it at that... The worse part, however, is N26's clear inability and unwillingness to address and fix these issues.

Do not open an ""account"" with N26.,A bank- or any consumer business- should be judged by how it performs in its worst moments and not its best. N26 is a perfect example. This innovative start-up has gained customers and market penetration but has done so at the expense of its customers: its' tech platform is unstable and its customer service is non-existent. Truly- you'll get five answers for a question but NEVER get a person on the telephone. Though N26 promotes itself as an online bank, that's a ruse. When problems arise its ability to solve them requires the sort of traditional intervention of staff to solve problems that can't be solved by an algorithm. And its investment in staff is abysmally low. I've been locked out of my account- while traveling overseas- for three weeks now. Despite assurances that my debit card would continue to work it does not (see below). I've had to make costly compromises to how I bank myself abroad that have wiped out any advantage that N26 promotes- and has cost me hundreds of dollars. Prior to this debacle I had bad consistently bad experiences over the past 18 months: five terminated / dropped online conversations and a wait as long as 90 minutes for an ONLINE chat. No kidding- an online chat. I'm told by insiders that N26 spends 10,000x more money on customer acquisition than it does on customer service. ,N26 is focused on building a paying customer base but fails miserably in terms of customer service. When I received a response a week or so after my account was locked it came from the ""Complaints Department"" (not a Customer Service Department as you would expect.) To wit, I'm not a complain I'm a customer- a distinction that's lost on this tone-deaf company.  Its founders are worth over $100 million while customers' needs are ignored. This is why banking gets a bad name and tech founders a reputation as entitled predators.","Hey, thank you for reaching out.,We sincerely apologise for this situation.,Please be aware that we’re currently experiencing a high volume of enquiries.

As an American expat living in Europe I found the traditional banks slow, bureaucratic, and difficult to work with.  N26 seemed like the perfect answer.

I'm not sure how my account was flagged but it was.,And every interaction with support has ranged from frustrating to miserable as I explain again and again how I need to access my account.  After two weeks of this--contacting support every single day--I was told that my account needed to be closed and to send an email to support to transfer the funds.  This was over a week ago and still I have not received any of my money back or any kind of update.  It took another two hours and four separate support chats this morning just to verify that my email was received.  But the agent STILL could not say when I would receive my funds.,In the meantime, I am unable to receive my paycheck, pay my rent or bills - life has ground to a halt.

This is a relatively simple process where we dispute the card charge with Mastercard to claim your funds back. The chargeback process also applies if your card has been stolen or used where you did not authorise it. ,If you have sent funds via a bank transfer, the necessary step would be to initiate a Payment Investigation to track the funds. As you have to confirm a bank transfer yourself from within your own mobile app, and enter your unique PIN, it can be more difficult to retrieve the funds, but a Payment Investigation can be started.,It is possible to contact us via phone from directly within your mobile app if you are an N26 Metal customer.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-09-17T20:57:21.000Z,No access to account,"Before I start complaining and explaining my current situation, I want to start off by saying that I was initially very happy with N26: A mobile bank! This was great for my, since I frequently travel abroad. A Debit card that I can use around the world and connect to all kinds of apps (my usual bank doesn't have this option). For about half a year, this worked great for me and would recommend N26 to people in need of something similar.,Then came the moment when I suddenly had to verify my account using the 2-step authentication. Usually, that shouldn't be a problem, but I'm using a different phone number now (old phone got stolen). After chatting a few times (since there is no phone number available), they called me back with a lot of questions to confirm my identity. So far, everything made sense and my number was changed to the correct number. All was good again :),Or so I thought. Then It was time to verify my login by inserting the SMS code I would receive by SMS. You might have guessed it at this point, but no code would ever be sent to my phone. I did receive some kind of error and tried to have the SMS message resent a couple of times, but with no positive result. The number must be correct, since they also managed to call me back.,It's 5 days later now and I still do not have access to my bank account. If have no idea how much money is still on that account and have no way to transfer it to another. The only way for me to know for sure if there is enough money on that account for anything, is by getting cash out of the ATM and pay for everything in cash (which means I also pay the €2,00 fee every time I get money out of an ATM). ,So since last Friday i've been contacting customer service by using the 'live chat'. The service agents keep telling me they will be in contact 'today' or 'tomorrow'. Today marks day 5 after first contact. Today I spoke with a service agent who told me it could take a 'few weeks'. At this point I didn't know what I was reading. A few weeks being unable to check my own balance, let alone transfer funds to pay bills! He did not seem to appreciate it very much when I told him waiting for weeks wasn't really an option for me.,Now, I work in customer service myself and have seen some crazy things, but never as crazy as having to wait a few weeks before I can access my account. I understand (and appreciate) that there are security protocols. But when I give all my personal details and tell them the exact amounts and locations of my last transactions to confirm my identity, they still can't help me at all and the only thing for me to do is wait.,Moral to the story: Great app when everything works, but customer service has a lot to learn.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2019-09-16T14:14:05.000Z,General view of the service,"Customer Support:,- There is no phone number. It existed because I called it because of a technical problem and the impossibility of solving it due to the absence of the internet.,To date it means that if you find yourself without internet due to a technical breakdown of your phone or a local network problem, you will not have access to your account nor to customer support. Not really very well.,- Providing customer support exclusively through a chat, on a 7cmx12cm screen is not exactly the top of UX, especially when it comes to serious problems and not simple questions.,- Providing customer support via desktop PC chat offers several problems, such as authentication.,The authentication consists of the request for 3 questions, of which the third asks you to communicate the fifth charge to your account or the names of at least two companies with recurring charge and relative amount.,The problem is that the agents in question do not always offer you the possibility to say which are the recurring charges and if you cannot have access to the account to tell them the fifth charge received, they simply close the chat.,In addition to the agents that sometimes close the chat even without explanation, you can also add any connection problems, both on the phone and on the desktop.,In short, a truly painful experience. There is a lot of talk about making life simpler but a company with millions of euros in financing can't even get a phone line which could simply authenticate the call from the app itself like airbnb does.,- Bank Transfer Process,Since performing mobile operations does not represent maximum comfort, there is a desktop version that becomes useless, as instead of sending a text message with confirmation code for the bank transfer which could be easily read on screen without open the sms itself, N26 app sends a push notification that requires the manual confirmation of the transfer, unlocking the mobile phone screen and logging into the app.,How to make life complicated.,- Double authentication,Recently N26 has adapted to the European double authentication standard, obviously here too, it did it in the most complicated way possible.,1. I go to log into the bank account via my computer, I can't, the bank says I have to confirm the access on my mobile.,2. Meanwhile, via the bank's app, I receive a push notification asking me to confirm the access, but I can't do it at the first ""tap"", I must first unlock the screen, while the notification has disappeared from the screen.,3. To confirm, in any case, I have to log in to my account on the app installed in the mobile, to which you ask yourself what sense to log into the account on the mobile to confirm access to the account from the desktop, and you also wonder why not have sent a simple text message with a code, which, among other things, can be read on the screen without unlocking the cell and logging into the account.,4. I find out that you can actually request a text message, but to do so, in the pop-up that says ""confirm access to your account"" I have to click on ""help"", at the point a new pop-up opens, explaining that by clicking on ""send"" you will receive a text message with a confirmation code.,I do it, but then the bank's website tells me ""sorry it's been too long"",Considering that there are more chances that they will steal my phone than they have of accessing my PC or discovering user and password and accessing it from another PC, I would say that we are doing very well.,It is worth noting that between sending the SMS as the main solution and then eventually the push notification of the app, the banks had complete discretion on how to manage the token.,- Transparency,N26 is exactly like any other bank, if they can lie or deceive you for an advantage, they will do it without problems.,In principle, the monthly withdrawals were free and unlimited, the bank used a lot of leverage on this in their advertisements.,Then the free withdrawals were reduced to 5 monthly after which you pay to withdraw.,Even the bank account had to be free, but then they changed that too and now a questionable credit check is performed, if you don't get a certain score, they offer you a paid bank account. Arguable because it happened to a friend of mine who has absolutely no problems.,In essence, if you can avoid it, you avoid it.","Hi Erik, thanks for taking the time to let us know.

Your N26 account gets blocked for any number of ""reasons"" meaning a whole load of ridiculous ""ID re-verification"" palaver each time in order to unblock it.,N26 Customer service is practically impossible to reach. There is no phone service to reach N26 Bank, and if you can't get into your N26 account, then it can be nigh on impossible to reach their text ""chat"" service. ,N26 have now messed up my account again with some app update, which means yet again I can't get into my account - neither by the N26 website nor via the N26 app on mobile phone. Great. Now I have to spend hours chasing around trying to get into contact with the practically non-existent N26 ""support"". ,I am also very concerned about the risks of my N26 account suddenly being ""frozen"" for any of their numerous spurious reasons, which causes innocent people real problems. Plenty of examples of this kind of treatment from N26 can be found both here at the Trustpilot as well as elsewhere online.,N26's marketing promotions and general tone is also glib and irritating. Emails from N26 that address you with ""hey"", and pictures of happy smiling ""support"" people that you never can reach (they  probably don't even exist in reality, maybe they are just standard image library pictures)  N26 are a heap of dung with what must be the worst customer service of any bank.

The button ‘contact support’ in the mail opens the N26 app on my phone and nothing more. No support here. The App support link on the App Store opens a ‘page not found’. After searching any support on their website, I found a chat support. A person named ‘Joao’ asked me for a few details and decided that the mail address I gave him was not ok. So he closed the chat with the comment ‘I appreciate the effort, but the information you have provided is not matching the one in our system (...) I will now have to close this chat. Have a great day!’. The information I gave them was fine, I triple checked it and they used it to send me information mails. Seems there is a huge support problem with N26, beside this, it is the first time a chat agent refuses to help and hangs up on me. I contacted them on their Facebook site, they replied and asked for two questions. I answered. Then no more reply. I reminded them and receive the same initial two questions seems to be a chat robot.

If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  ,Summary of my issues with N26:,- In-app verification process failed (many, many times),- In-app video chat/ verification failed (and took many, many attempts to connect to a verification agent),- When answered, the in-app video chat/ verification agents did not speak English and abruptly terminated my video calls without reason (four times),- My requests to close my N26 account and delete my data were met with emailed auto-responses from N26 to ""try again"",- Since closing my N26 account (finally), I am still receiving unsolicited email from N26 addressed to another person (not me) i.e. my data have not been deleted.  ,I can't review my actual use of N26 because the verification process failed over and over again [...]*  ,I do not recommend signing up with N26 until major improvements happen, with particular regard to improving the poor quality N26 in-app customer support. Customer satisfaction is paramount to the success of any public-facing business. I am not confident that N26 can take care of my money securely!

A year later in Switzerland I was able to  change my phone number, after a long call to the N26 help line. But I love they have no atm withdrawal fees in Europe (for some amount per month).

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-09-10T07:56:37.000Z,The worst online banking,"Very bad support, misinformation on their app and never protect customer rights. ,1. I got charged from the ATM without any information and N26 showed me this ATM on their app. When I asked them to investigate on it they said sorry we can not do something. We can just check our app. Sorry but if you show me that I have free withdrawals and show me some list of ATMs and then I got charged more you have to at least investigate on it and give me detailed information instead of saying sorry. ,2. Once I bought a flight ticket and in the last step when they asked me to approve the payment through 3D security I just declined because I found others. I cancelled it but it got charged. When I asked to investigate that they said they can not. If you can not protect my account with 3D security why you have it? If you give permission to the other system to charge me even if I decline it?,3. Every time when I write something to them I disconnect automatically and connect the new person and they ask to explain everything again and again. They always try to prove that the problem is on my connection which I tried mobile, wi-fi and ethernet. And this problem occurred in all of them.","Hi Sanan,,Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.,We do offer an ATM map within the app, however this is simply a guide which indicates which ATMs around you can accept your N26 Mastercard. This does not mean that some of these ATMs may not charge you a private fee for availing of their service, however it should be displayed onscreen before withdrawing that a fee may be charged. We have no influence over private ATM fees, and therefore cannot refund them. In the event you are charged by N26 for a withdrawal once you have passed your free withdrawal limit, the maximum amount would be 2 EUR.,It seems that the authorisation to debit the funds from your account had happened with your attempted ticket purchase. This would reserve the amount for the merchant to collect for your purchase. As it was not completed, the funds will simply bounce back to your account without need for further action.,Please note that it is also possible to access live chat via desktop from within the web app in the event you are having issues with mobile.

It came as a surprise to me that I am not able to do that anymore because N26 thinks that people from North Macedonia should not be able to use their services. This is a discriminatory politics of the bank especially to me as an already existing customer with regular income. I trusted the bank to keep all my incomes for 8 months and as a result I was asked to move to other bank. They advised me to open new bank account where they will transfer all my money. There was nothing to worry about they said. ,From this point I was not able to use the account as before. I was not able to check my bank statement on the application, was not able to do direct debit or receive money on the account. On the email I was informed that I will be able to do all of the above, but because of some unexplained reason I was not able. ,I ended without receiving my August salary on the account and not being able to transfer money for rent or electricity and at the same time I started to receive letters in my mailbox to pay all outstanding bills. I am risking to loss my apartment or have a bad SCHUFA score just because N26 changed its mind who can use their services and is taking so long to do the final step and transfer the money to the new account. I had already more then 10 conversations with chat support, through email and phone calls and everyone was ensuring me that it will be done soon. From last Wednesday I am not able to use the account at all. My money are trapped by N26 and I feel helpless and really worried.,I am sure that my case is not unique and other people are experiencing the same issue. I already advised a lot of Macedonians to start the process of closing the N26 account before N26 ask for that and end up in a loop without any sign of end.","Hey Filip,,We apologise that you found yourself in this situation.

The reason that a document cannot be accepted is usually due to the lack of security features on said document. Our current list of accepted documents can be found here, and we are constantly trying to add more to the list: https://docs.n26.com/cs/Support%20Center/Verification/201804-supporteddocs-DE-EN.pdf,We hope that a resolution for this issue has been reached, but we encourage you to reach out to us via support@n26.com or our Twitter Support channel if you require any further assistance.,Best Regards,,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5d700cdc21dfcb3f92d78e1e,1,DE

I talked several times with customer support, and each time it was the same: reinstall APP, prey to God it works  - it didn't,  still doesn't ,3rd - I  was asked to revalidate my ID, and for some reason they could not do it (although it is the same ID I used while creating the account - my passport), and now I am locked out of the APP, which means no money transfers, no online payments, no nothing - just card payments (on POS) and ATM withdrawals, but that does not help me pay bills or rent - so I don't have full access to my money (and I am still waiting for a solution from their end, and it has been 3 days already).,If they fix their APP, and put in place the necessary processes to offer speedy solutions for critical issues (like mine), than it is wort it - if not, then maybe it's better if you go to a ""normal"" bank...,L.E. I decided to cancel my collaboration with them, and as they were sending an email of good-bye, with this in it:,""While this process is being completed you can use your card normally, make purchases and withdraw from ATMs, receive transfers, use overdraft services, insurance and credit services."",...in parallel they were also blocking my account, so, in fact, now I can't even use the card at a POS or ATM, so, I am totally blocked from reaching or using my money.

All goes well, until it doesn't, until they randomly decide to block your account and access to your own funds.,Since August 21, 2019 my account is unlawfully blocked. Numerous attempts to contact N26's customer service, gain further insight and solve this issue remained unsuccessful. I am meanwhile seven days without any access to my account. I have to assume that payments I initiated are not processed either. I urged them to take immediate steps and, yet, the only thing their customer agents on their chat are able to say is that my query is being handled, they have no visibility on anything else, and I shall receive an email soon (no ETA). Then, they close the chat. ,Summary:,19.08.2019 – I received an email requesting to re-verify my identity as a routine procedure that all banks have to follow, which I did straight away. In this email it stated that during the re-verification process I would be able to use my N26 card to make purchases or withdrawals, receive money, just would not be able to access my N26 app.,21.08.2019 – Whilst I was trying to pay for my taxi fare, my card was declined and a message on my screen appeared: “We couldn’t process your transaction because your account has been blocked. We’ll email you with details.” I contacted your support team via chat and I was told there was nothing that could be done, my “account was seized” and they couldn’t give me more information apart from the fact that I’d be contacted soon by email. Several agents closed the chat on me without giving me any further information and refusing to escalate this issue. My funds were seized and I didn’t have access to it nor did I have any estimation of when N26 would provide an explanation or transfer my funds to another account. I promptly provided another account number for my money to be transferred.,23.08.2019 – I received an email stating that I haven’t followed the request to verify my identity, resulting in my N26 account being terminated. This is probably from an incorrect template, as I had re-verified my identity on the same date as I received the 1st email (which also stated that I had until the 09.09.2019 to do so. In the same email, there was a request to provide my new account details AGAIN (3rd time) for N26 to transfer my funds.,Between 21.08 and 26.08, several direct debits have been declined and as I haven’t had access to my funds, I have been unable to settle them yet. As of now, I haven’t received my funds in the alternative account number I provided., ,I am elsewise forced to engage legal support and file for injunctive relieve – demanding coverage of any potential costs or damage that will be caused by the unjustified seizure of my account.,It's now the 28th of August and this issue is still pending.","Hey Luciana,,We apologise if you were not provided with a follow up regarding your case.

They are currently holding my money, have closed my account without any good reason, blocked my card and refusing to respond to emails and help requests. I threatened the Police and they suddenly become interested, momentarily, and then reverted to nonsensical responses and now silence.

You cannot run this card like other debit cards (as pin-less transactions at restaurants). I had this card decline at a big client dinner and it negatively impacted my reputation. They do not state anywhere obvious about the lack of functionality compared to other banks.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2019-08-23T21:56:58.000Z,Tech is good but customer service is horrendous.,"Like many others here I've had bad experiences with N26's customer service. The first time while verifying my ID the woman just hung up on me when I kindly asked her to repeat what she had just said, so I had to start a new session and do everything over again. There was no way for me to know her name or report her after, so the customer service representatives aren't held accountable for their actions.,The second time, I had a Metal card which comes with ""Premium"" customer service, but when I needed to change my phone number, I started a support session on my phone, but had to wait about 30 minutes. During that time my screen turned off and I lost the session, so I started over again but on my computer this time. I waited for an hour, and I was 3rd in place, but it was too late in the day so they just shut down their customer service completely and I had to try again the following day. ,Also note for those who use Spaces and Overdraft. You will be charged for Overdraft even if you have more than enough money to cover the overdraft in your Spaces. I had more than 1k€ in spaces but got charged for my main balance going negative. That's a scam if I ever saw one. ,Overall the app and tech is great, but N26 still falls short in a few too many places.","Hi Matthew, thanks for taking the time to let us know.

They have millions of customers but on the other hand they block tens of thousands of accounts daily - due to their faulty algorithms which flag transactions for no reason. Furthermore, because of the high volume of blocks and complaints relating to them the customer service is paralyzed. ,My experience is as follows: opened an account, transferred money into it, started using the app and card, used it for three weeks, nothing suspicious nothing illegal. Then one day when I had been using VPN to access television app from my home country, and had forgotten VPN ""on"" on my phone I opened the N26 app. It instantly asked to verify my Face-ID again, which I did. I also closed my VPN and logged successfully in again. Three hours from that I received an email that my account is going to be closed based on the very same terms which have been covered here in almost every review. ,My assumption is that N26 algorithms flagged my account because based on the IP-addresses it seemed that my account was accessed from two different countries within one minute. This would most likely also explain why a lot of N26 customers have been stranded at airports when all of the sudden their accounts are not working. ,In my case I was lucky. N26 gave me 14 days to empty my account and kept my app and card working. Not everyone is so lucky though. There seems to be three kinds of scenarios. Mine already mentioned, second where all transactions are blocked but the person is paradoxically being asked to empty the account, and third where the account is entirely blocked on the spot.,Good luck with N26 account. I wouldn't trust them. I'm back using old fashioned banks where there's customer service who know what they're talking about and are able to provide a lot more than an apologetic spam letter which is soon sent out as an answer to this review, too.","Hey,,As a fully-fledged bank, N26 must submit itself to banking regulations in place.

I opened my account almost two months ago and still haven't received my card. A lot of N26 is tied to their mobile app which you can't access without having received the card. The first card was 'undeliverable' (?), and so I opened up a support chat and was told that they would order me a new one. I paid to have the card sent express as I have over 4000 euros in my account and need to pay rent! Turns out the absolute imbecile I talked to never actually ordered my card, so I was told another one would be ordered and express shipped free of charge. The next day I was yet to receive any confirmation (which I was told I should expect to receive) so I went to the support chat for (literally) the 10th time to find out more.

First you cannot make payments to o2 and several other companies due to address issues. I tried to make several purchases online which get declined but the payment is taken and you have to wait up to 10 days to get the money back. I cancelled a direct debit but it was still taken and when I contacted them they said it would take at most 2 days to get my money back, it took a week. I raised a query as to why I couldn’t make payments to o2 and no one has ever bothered replying. I had to find out myself that it’s due to the way the bank stores your address details and why I spoke to an agent on chat I was told that if I want to order things online I need to contact the company prior and change the address format first in order for the payment not to decline. What started off so promising has turned into an absolute nightmare and over the last few months I’ve spent most of the time trying to get my own money back or having to get other people to make my payments or order things for me.","Hey Danny,,Thanks for taking the time to let us know.

Whilst on holiday I tried to withdraw some money using my N26 card from an atm then decided to cancel the transaction as the withdrawal charge was ridiculous so I decided to try a different atm to see that my card was rejected to insufficient funds and I thought that was odd I have money on the card so tried again again rejected to checked the app to find that the money had been taken off my account!

Being told I have to do this and that which I did several times and it didn’t work. Got to the point where I had to fill in a form for a cash back refund or whatever. I was told once the form was sent off they would keep me updated with what was happening and they didn’t have a specific time frame for this. A couple of weeks had passed and hadn’t heard anything so gave them a quick email asking if there were any updates and I got the most blunt and rude reply. Telling me to be patient and they will update when they see any info and there’s no time frame for this. Couple more weeks passed.... nothing. Emailed again saying I was sorry for the bother and asked on the progress and was told that they will get in contact when they can and that it could take up to 36 days from when they send the form off to get the money back. Finally got an email saying that I would receive the credit in my account within the next 12 days. This was 4 days ago.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-07-02T14:32:32.000Z,I can’t even open an account,"Well I wasn’t even able to open an account! I had a few initial problems uploading my documents and had to repeat the process a number of times. When I didn’t receive an email telling me there was a further problem I assumed they’d finally gone through. The app kept telling me that my documents were being verified which could take up to 5 business days. Nearly 3 weeks and several chats with their support team later I was told the selfie wasn’t good enough. Ok, can I submit another? No, I was told I’d need to wait for the original agent to which I had originally enquired to contact me to tell me my application had been unsuccessful. Ridiculous! So now I’m looking for another bank so I can start all over again. Thanks N26, if I’d known 3 weeks ago what I know now I’d probably have an account already.,*In reply to your response, you have completely misunderstood what I have said. I wasn’t complaining that you have to present ID, I was complaining that until today I wasn’t told that there was an issue with my documents, despite speaking to a number of you customer service agents before. In fact, it’s only due to my dogged determination to try to resolve the issue that I eventually found an agent who was able to supply me with the reason for the delay. Furthermore, why wasn’t I able to simply re-submit my documents today? Why would I have to wait another x weeks to be told “oh you can’t have an account because we can’t clearly make out your ID”? Your system is flawed in this regard and unless you fix it you will lose customers.","Hey,,We regret to learn you were provided with such experience.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-06-04T14:01:36.000Z,Its Easy - To FRUSTRATE you - not for banking,"I had a simple issue to add my phone number to my account. Without which i can not even transact anything online ( Basically useless account online ). Just for the basic issue which any bank in the world would take a few minutes, N26 has not been able to resolve it since 2 weeks. I mean seriously, it is the level of your online banking. How could you be sure about the security of it when the data executives take 2 weeks to add a phone number. I am frustrated to tell this thing to every customer care executive and in the end i get a message that the isue is escalated and nothing happens after even 2 weeks. Now the money would be blocked as i cant transfer any money without my phone number linked to my phone. You can not even talk verbally to any customer care executive unless you have their paid account of Black card. You cant even chat to them 24x7. To be honest my friend uses a DKB and its just way way beyond N26. In my experience if you want an example where you should not have an account is N26. Avoid it the best you can. Seriously Dissapointed.","Hey Devendra,,Thanks for getting in touch! We are sorry to hear this issue has not been resolved yet.  We are very committed in making this right! We have sent you an email.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2019-06-04T09:17:39.000Z,Doesn't support the most basic functions,"I really wanted to like N26 and to be able to use it as my primary account but it's just not possible.,It doesn't support the most basic banking functions which I would expect on any bank account (this is all for UK accounts as of 2019-06-03):,* Direct debit is not supported,* No overdraft,* No standing orders,* Cannot save recipient details: This shocked me. It's such an easy feature to add. When I send money to a friend I expect it to be able to remember the contact details so I can use them again in the future.,Finally the big selling point for me was that they supposedly had a fully functional website which I could use to send money and view my transaction history (most challenger banks for some reason don't have this). It turns out this isn't completely true. To send a transaction you still need to confirm on your phone which makes it quite pointless since the reason I want a website is for when I don't have access to my phone.,To end on a positive note: The set up was fast and easy and the support is good. Their app looks pretty as well (although feature wise it could also use quite a bit of improvement).,I will look at N26 again next year and I hope they have fixed all of these issues. If they have then I will gladly give them another try. Oh well, back to a traditional bank for now it seems :(,EDIT: Reply to N26,When I contacted your support I was told that direct debit was not supported (about a month ago). Well I guess that's one less thing stopping me from using N26.,As for the security of paired devices; a phone is not necessary more secure than a computer. Most banks are fine with using a computer without the phone, I see no reason why N26 should be any different. Also if you want extra security you could use a standard like OTP (e.g. with Google Authenticator) that way it is up to the customers if they want to have the app installed on their phone and if they want to have the OTP credentials on other devices like their computers.","Hi Keeyan,,Thank you for taking the time to leave this feedback. We value your opinions and suggestions greatly as it is paramount to our growth and development.,We can confirm that it is possible to set up a direct debit with your N26 UK account, however this must be done directly through the merchant by providing them with your N26 details. If a merchant is not accepting these details, please contact us via live chat so that we are aware.,Standing orders, overdrafts, and saving payees are all on our roadmap for N26 UK as we understand they are an important feature for our customers. These features are available in our European app, and we are working hard to implement them for our UK customers soon. ,As we are a mobile bank, it is necessary that you must have your paired mobile device with you when making a transfer. We do this as it is an added security measure for the safety of your account - a transfer can only be actioned when you have selected ""confirm"" in the one mobile device paired to your account.,We encourage you to email any suggestions you have for improvement to ideas@n26.com, as we love to hear any ideas you may have!,Best Regards,,Your N26 Support Team",/users/5cf4e589bd952032893329e5,15,GB

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-05-31T17:39:41.000Z,"Money blocked for crypto, they won't give money back","Hi,,This is a warning for people wanting to open an account with N26.,I am Pol Smith. My N26 Credit Card ID is XXX,My IBAN is XXX,My date of birth XXX ,(information removed due to N26 security issues),My account has been cancelled in an extremely unfair way. I don't know exactly why N26 decided my account to be cancelled, but I think it must be due to having transferred funds to Coinbase (cryptocurrencies exchange), which was the last wire transfer I tried to do. This transfer was intended to do on 15.05.2019 for the amount of 1,366.27 EUR, and it bounced back the same day. 2 days later, on 17.05.2019, my N26 bank account was blocked and I haven't had access to my money since then.,N26 says they run a ""routine check"" on accounts to ""keep accounts secure"". However, they never end the ""investigation"" while they keeping the money unaccessible on the account.,In any case - according to this Cancellation Email, my account will remain functional up until 31.05.2019, so I should move my full balance before that. Here is an extract from this email:,---,This termination is effective as of: ,31.05.2019 ,Your account remains functional until the stated date. After termination, usage of the account, the app, as well as the card issued with it, is no longer possible. ,We would like to make sure your remaining funds get transfered to you. ,Please transfer your funds to an alternative bank account before the date of termination. ,---,Contrary to what the Cancellation Email says, my N26 account and my N26 credit card have not been functional since then, and therefore I haven't been able to withdraw nor use or transfer my money out of the N26 account.,After having told this issue to N26 several times by email, live chat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, now N26 are not doing anything in order to give me my money back. They don't let me transfer my money out, the credit card and the account are totally blocked (note it's note 31.05.2019 yet) and N26 email support is not transferring my funds to an alternative bank account even though I sent them the IBAN, BIC and an official proof for my alternative bank account to be mine. I sent these document 7 days ago and about 5 times since then, and still no reply.,Live chat has told me my account is ""under investigation"" and ""being worked on by the appropriate department"". However, there is no estimated date, days pass by and there is no estimated day, not even an email or update.,I followed the steps mentioned on the page ""How to file a Complaint"" from N26 website, but that doesn't seem to make N26 really work on my case or resolve the case either.,N26 say ""we must close an account after these checks have been completed"". In reality, what N26 does is not answering any emails and keep saying they are ""investigating my case"". Seems this ""investigation process"" will never end.,N26 say they are ""regulated and licensed bank, we are obliged to adhere to European banking processes. We don't close accounts without a good reason"". However, real and non-fraudulent banks don't cancel accounts for trying to make a transfer to a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase, like it happened to me. ,N26: is trying to make a transfer to Coinbase a really good reason for which a bank should cancel and block all access to the money from a user, not letting the customer transfer it out?,N26 says ""We endeavour to contact you as soon as possible to inform you of our decision"". However, in reality they have no phone number to contact, they don't reply emails and by live chat they just say to have ""no further information"" and just close the chat. Whenever I messaged N26 that this was very urgent as I needed my full balance (2,366.27 EUR) in my account as soon as possible, they either didn't reply or said I should wait to get an email (which never arrives).,I think the only way to make N26 reply to me might be writing this review (at least, I might get an automated reply as they do with all Trustpilot reviews). Or better, maybe the only and ""real"" solution to get money back might be contacting Ombudsmand, Bafin, etc.,EDIT #1: N26 did reply to this review. According to their reply, I removed sensitive information (Credit card Id,  IBAN and date of birth) of my N26 account in this review. They also mentioned they cant provide further information in here. However, they are not providing information on any channel either,  since I am not being answered by email either.,EDIT #2: (27.05.2019) I just received an email from N26 with the following text:,---,Hey Pol,,Thanks for getting in touch!,I can confirm that we have received your document with your bank details and we already have a dedicated Team handling it now. We will contact you as soon as we have completed this process.,We will try to be as brief as possible, we appreciate your patience.,---,EDIT #3 (28.05.2019) I just received an email from N26 with the following text:,---,Dear Pol, ,Thank you for your emails. ,Please be assured we continue to work on your case. ,As this is a complicated and complex process, it will take time for us to resolve. ,Nevertheless, we have requested this case to be prioritised and will update you as soon as we have more information. ,I sincerely appreciate your continued patience. We will be in touch again soon. ,Kindest Regards,,N26 Complaints Management,---,EDIT #4 (31.05.2019),My account has been fully cancelled. I cannot log into my account anymore, it says ""Bad Credentials"" now.,I still haven't received a reply from N26 by email.,Live chat says they have ""no further information"". They cannot even tell me who should I contact or if my case is being worked on: they just close the chat.,I sent another email to N26 (I already sent Support, VIP and Complaints department team about 20 emails).,---,I will keep updating this review until I receive my money back","Hi Pol,,We kindly ask that you remove the sensitive account and card information that you have included in your review, in the interest of security.

They have a simple to use app and most things can be solved by customer service who do want to listen to you. There are a few things which they need to add to the service to get a higher rating and make them easier, which I have ben told baby customer service are coming:,1) Saving the payment data and the reference - for regular payments it is a problem to keep putting in bank info. You want to be able to save it and then make the payment. Especially if this is a regular payment, such as a credit card or rent payment, which are typically larger value payments. I often send a small amount and then a larger amount once I know the funds have been received. It can be quite scary not being able to do this.,2) Payments to large corporates - It would be good when making a transfer if the large corporate information could be searched so you don't have to go and put it in yourself. some banks have this info and I'm sure N26 could get that as well.,3) Statements - a facility to get monthly statements emailed would be helpful as again I cant see how that can be done.

The MasterCard arrived two days later. Account and card do what they are meant to do and their App design and functionality are fab. Sadly, I ran into a spot of trouble with them, when I asked for a direct debit to be reversed. The original message was, that I should see the funds back, “shortly”, then four days later it was within “the next 48 hours”. This did not happen either, and now the communication around the re-credit has become rather elusive. “Real soon” is the best I get. Given that I was so happy with them, this is rather disappointing: As a bank and financial institution their communicated timelines need to be dependable, as I am making representations on the back of those. As always in finance there are repercussions, if I need to backtrack on my promises.,Checking the news, though, it appears, that I am not the only one with this concern as the German BaFin appears to have unearthed similar issues. ,Hopefully they manage to improve around this area, as I can otherwise recommend N26.",,/users/5ad85b534de5666d348d1147,4,GB

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-05-21T10:07:01.000Z,"Absolute joke of a Bank, do not recommend!","Been using N26 for about a year now as a bills account. I make monthly transfers from my personal account on a once or twice monthly basis, never gone over 10 transactions a month.,This month is where N26 has really let me down; I'm moving in with the other half, and we both transferred deposit and first month payment into the account (10th May) totalling £1000 into the account. My payment went through fine, and the other half's not so lucky.,My account has been in review since with the other halfs payment missing from the account completely. We are supposed to be moving in this Friday (17th May), but with no signs of the money being in the account this has caused a lot of stress between us.,I contacted customer services on Saturday (11th May) who informed me the money would be in by Monday (13th May) - didn't happen. Contacted customer services on Tuesday (14th May) Where I was told my account is under investigation and couldn't provide further details.,When this is resolved, I have no doubts at all I'll be closing the account, and won't look back. No sense of urgency in resolving my account issue.,EDIT #1: N26 emailed me 2 mins after posting this review (11:47am), asking to provide addition information. I responded with additional information at 12:01pm. Still no sign of Friday nights transfer within my account after providing screenshots of the transaction from each account - now being asked of proof we're moving house. To which I've provided a screenshot of our application and an email between me and my estate agents confirming contact/move in is on the 17th May. Was this needed, even after providing proof of where the money came from? Eagerly awaiting a further response.,EDIT #2: N26 emailed to confirm they've sent the information over the the relative department (1:44PM) - Still missing payment from the other half, from Friday 10th. The closer it gets to Friday 17th the more stress we are feeling, all from an issue many others have previously talked about. Surely a phone call about this matter would have been far more sufficient if the case is this critical - alike a regular bank?,EDIT #3: N26 emailed again (2:57PM) saying they have completed 'routine checks' and everything should be back as normal. But the payment from the other half is still missing. Very disappointing so far, The response time has defiantly increased since leaving a negative review, yet the underlying problem has yet been resolved - and shouldn't take a bad review to jump on a problem.,EDIT #4: As end of the day draws near (4:15pm), I contacted customer support via the live chat asking if I could have further clarification on where my money was. To be honest the support agent was probably the most helpful agent so far - by providing me with the complaints email and advised the case had in fact not been completed - even after saying I could use my account as normal.,EDIT #5: 5:15pm now, with no further correspondence, or notice when we will receive our money. Formal complaint has been sent to the complaints address now.,EDIT #6: Sent another email as its now the last day until me and the other half move in together (16th at 9:45am), Still missing a £400 payment - Not acceptable.,EDIT #7: We've received a letter from Lloyds Bank (the other half's bank) as they have also investigated and tracked the payment  Confirming N26 have the funds, I've provided everything required and N26 has confirmed everything has been sorted with my account. So, Where is our money? Can't believe it's quicker to investigate and track down the payment rather N26 Just release our money...,EDIT #8: This is getting very long winded, I've had to leave work early due to the stress of moving tomorrow with no money in my account. Are N26 going to cover my losses for today? Doubtful. We are so stresses and is causing tension between me and the other half. Was told via live chat the money could have been refunded - REFUNDED? Imagine if i just sold my car to someone, and the had a car and their money back - you simply can't do that?! I highly suggest N26 give us our money now, a call would be nice about now explaining whats going on.,EDIT #9 (Conclusion): I Finally received my money back on Thursday 16th May at around 4pm. The sheer stress this has caused is beyond belief. I'm still without an explanation and formal apology for the whole fiasco. Will be tying the account up and closing the account in the coming few days.,To be completely honest, N26 does have potential, the app is easy to use and the interface is good, just a shame about customer experience is abysmal.","Hi Brandon,,In accordance with certain European banking processes, we are legally obliged to carry out regular routine checks on user accounts and transactions.

Why doesn't the app can learn that? Why the system resets my settings? Isn't this against ""usability rules"" which says that the user should have control over his/her options/ways of using the system?,2) When I change the category for e.g. Vodafone which is recurrent expense and is taken automatically from my account, the app doesn't learn the new category, but I have the change the category every single time - every month. This is not difficult to implement. It is just couple of rows of code. I think this feature affect on the expenses pie chart also, and that way it has quite big impact on the system. The user needs to make unnecessary acts to keep the expenses pie chart up-to-date, even though it is easy to automise.,3) On website, I have to go to my profile to be able to logout. Why there is no logout possibility in the main navigation / every page. This is against commonly know place to find logout functionality (which preferably should be followed in UX design). It took me a while to find a way to logout and caused frustration. ,But all in all, this is the best solution/system _in Germany_, but not Europe. Take a look of the solution of the Nordic web banks.

N26,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,2019-05-12T06:10:36.000Z,Easy online banking AND in English (for non-native speakers),"I set up my N26 account when arriving in Germany a little over two years ago. The process was relatively simple and all the security checks were done online and via a video call. In comparison, to be a co-signatory on a bank account with Berliner Volksbank, I had two or three trips to the bank, plus a few phone calls. I'm told that setting up a bank account in Germany is pretty painful, and this definitely wasn't the case with N26.,I'm a Black card customer, mostly because of the travel insurances that come with this which means I don't have to think about this when I go to visit friends back in the UK. I enquired about the Metal card because I saw that it had airport lounge benefits. It wasn't so easy to find out the precise details, first via the website, then via customer support, and then being told to call the airport Lounge partner. The end result was that there is a small discount to using airport Lounges (I can't remember exactly now, but it was either 24€ or 28€), and this doesn't really make it worth it for me.,The online interface is pretty intuitive and easy to use. It's a bit frustrating that if I use my computer with a web browser, I still have to authenticate all transactions on my mobile phone, but I assume this is necessary additional security. Again, in comparison, it's a lot easier than Berliner Volksbank.,The ""winning feature"" though as a non-native German living in Germany is that I can do my banking, including customer support, etc, all in English. This would be less daunting now that I've lived here for two years, but I wouldn't have wanted to deal with that on Day 1 in Germany.",,/users/5cd7b8d594dddb5300876996,1,DE

This will assist us greatly in improving our processes and services for the future.,In the interest of account safety and security, we will ask our customers to reset Face/Touch ID every 30 days. In relation to travelling abroad, our card is accepted worldwide with any merchant which accepts Mastercard.

In the event you run into an issue when making a transaction, you can contact us from within our mobile app via My Account > Help > Support Chat.,We grant a 30 day revocation period when you have opted for a premium Metal or Black account with us.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-05-09T14:22:48.000Z,Really bad customer service,"I am really disappointed with N26, I used it for my trip in South America. And one day I woke up someone did two transactions In India for 240€. I really don’t understand the security process of N26, how can I be in Equador one day and some few hours later in India. There should be a way where when you enter a new country the N26 ask for confirmation instead of just giving away money to Stranger especially India as there is a lot of bank fraud going there. The person was able to withdraw money in a ATM without my physical card witch should not be allowed or it should be a fonction that you can allow in N26. ,But what I am the most angry about is when I contacted an agent for help he was really unhelpful and could not understand my situation.  All he said to me was you have to cancel your card, I tried to explain that I was in South America and needed money but he kept repeating the same, and avoiding my question about security. ,In the end I really don’t think that this bank is safe it’s fun because they give you the choice to control your paramètre but it’s seriously missing security features. They add some stuff but forget the most important no one should be able to withdraw money from an ATM without a physical card or it should be linked first with security measure.","Hey Daxane,,We apologise for the inconvenience.,You can read more about the act of card skimming by reading this N26 Mag article: https://mag.n26.com/what-is-a-an-atm-skimmer-how-to-protect-your-bank-account-when-withdrawing-cash-e9447e24b809,If you don’t recognise a transaction or you’re sure you didn’t authorise it, blocking your card won’t be enough.

I joined just under 2 years ago.,Then on my card recently i had 2 unauthorised transactions. After having about 4 conversations with different agents explaining myself again and again (i dont think they leave notes anywhere on the acvoubt).. a few weeks later they tell me i need to fill a form out. Not an online form. Old school style..print it off..fill it in and sign it and then email it back. After a week they ask me AGAIN for the same information i gave 4 times on the chat. I replied. Then its just again the same questions per email. The chargeback amount is small so i told them to forget it. This is just not worth my time going back and forth having to have 10 different conversations repeating myself over and over again. They make this process very complex and comletely put me off trying to grt my money back. Anyway their reply was simply 'As per your request I have cancelled your chargeback request,'. Couldnt believe it. No acknowledgement that i told them i dont have time to waste on their over complex process where they make you go back and forth a million times.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-05-04T10:42:09.000Z,AVOID Banking equivalent to a tinder date with a Stalker,"Foolishly responded to free account link on an Instagram add that opened a ‘Free’ N26 account. ,During sign up I was shown the shinny metal card as a card option......so selected the shinny thing .... a few screens later my free account was now £14.50 month, with sketchy details of benefits (lounge access sounded nice but lounge key had zero details online), so I stepped back and instead selected basic card and opened the free version of the account.  ,I received no emails or other correspondence and no card arrived basic or otherwise.,Months later N26 long since forgotten a shinny metal card arrives to my home..,Ok so I guess no one was willing to pay £14.50 for nothing and now everyone gets the metal one......still no such thing as free so I did some research and saw that others had experienced this..... key callout was make sure it’s inactive in the App,So I launched the N26 app and saw that Metal account was indeed active, so I immediately deactivated it.,So to be clear I did not order the metal card and then cancelled the card account I did not as soon as unordered card was unexpectedly received.,Now months later I logged into app because it showed a notifications.... since the card and account was inactive I was curious at the notifications, so sought to read them before deleting them. ,They advised that I owed 2 x £14.50 to N26.....for the unordered card that was cancelled,So I used chat to get in touch....only available means for this bank.,Agent told me that since I did not cancel within 30 days I was now locked into a 12 month contract.,This is my worst ‘banking’ experience.,N26 is like going on a Tinder date with a stalker, sure you went on a date once but you ended the date in the first 10 minutes after realising their was no chemistry between you....,Meanwhile Stalky N26 went and told all its friends your dating and sent you a gift one month later that you did not return.......,So now N26 thinks your married.....,N26 even managed to get an online marriage certificate......... ,sure you did not sign anything.... but N26 saw the way you smiled in that dreamy first date, plus you loved his gift..... so that must mean your married right?,On the plus side I doubt N26’s marriage certificate will stand up to legal scrutiny......... but sadly that won’t get your wasted time back.,Searching trust pilot I see many people were just sent the metal card and then had my above experience even when they ordered the basic card one..... if only I’d done more research before clicking that Instagram ‘FREE BANK ACCOUNT’ link.,You would probably not knowingly date a stalker so don’t enter into any form of interaction with N26, unless that’s your thing. In which case I hope you and N26 have a nice life together.,Plenty of decent online banks that offer the same but without the stalky extortion component.

However, I have to point out their borderline scam tactique when it comes to their referral program.,N26 disqualifies numerous countries ad hoc from their heavily promoted monetary reward for a friend referral at their own discretion, without any mention to this in the T&C documents available to their customers. ,I have referred several of my friends to the service as I very much believe in the vision of N26 and I want to actively contribute the the success of the Bank in the future. My friends have activated their accounts and have been actively using them for payments meeting all the conditions speciied by N26 for an eligible referral. However I haven't received the monetary reward that N26 commits to in their T&C document.,When i contacted the support team, I was informed that my countrty is not eligible for the referral program (even though I have been able to refer my friends and have been receiving many emails from N26 prompting me to share my personalized referral link with my firends,with a promise of monetary reward) and that I will not receive my monetary reward. There is no mention of my country being ineligible in the T&C document and when I asked for such document, I have simply been told that it does not exist but I still won't receive my award.,I am writing this long review not because of the small monetary incentive which I will not receive, but because of my deep disappointment with the way N26 behaved to me as their customer and the way they addressed this situation. I believe that changing the rules of the referral program at their own discretion without any reference to the T&C documents of N26 is extremely intransparent and promulgates a negative perception of N26, as well as the whole    Fintech industry.,I hope N26 management will take their time to read this review as a constructive feedback from their customer and at the very least will update the T&C document of the referral program to transparently list the countries that are/are not eligible for the referral program and the receival of the monetary award threin referred to.",,/users/5cbb5c9b710f03566de50165,1,CZ

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2019-04-18T13:34:06.000Z,What a disappointment,"App is fine but overall very unsatisfied with the service. Held 1 year Black card, on the day of renewal there was no way to cancel from their web and did not have access to my mobile app. On a day of renewal they basically sent a link to the TC and said thats how it is, stay on Black for another year or cancel without refund. No flexibility! Because I told them incorrect ID card number (I have 3 passports) they just closed online chat without goodbye or anything. Only way for identity reverification was to send FAX! Or a physical mail copy! The whole online support feels like a automated manufacturing line. Plus the Allianz insurance is rigged too -  all travel purchases have to be made with the card and otherwise your trip is not covered. Also damaged luggage is not covered by the card. So here we go - second year forced to stay on Black card! So dear N26, if you want to make it up for me Im available via the email.","Thanks for taking the time to let us know.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2019-03-29T13:30:12.000Z,Very poor banking experience!,"Very poor banking experience indeed. Here are the reasons:,-Very very poor customer support. First, there is no way you can talk to a real person if you have a serious problem. The chat is a hit or miss. Most of the times, the chat support agent is not trained and does not know much about the issue you raised.,- They are terribly slow at responding to issues raised by email. After months of no replies and persistent requests for updates, they did reply back with ""sorry for the delay; we had issues with our system"". Really??!!,- The bank infrastructure has terribly poor security features. I requested umpteen times to have 2-Factor authentication on Twitter, by email, on Facebook and they never cared to consider. That said, money on an N26 account is at 100% risk to being stolen by hackers. There is not way N26 will become my default bank account. I use it for the convenience of seeing my payments in real-time (that's one pro), but that's the risk I take. I do a monthly standing order of a fairly small amount which I then use.,- The bank discriminates on nationalities: I think you try to follow some banking rules but I have no idea where these rules/restrictions come from. Because of my nationality, you said I could not use N26 Invest although you advertised the service is available in Germany. You failed to mention that you are picky on nationalities living in Germany. I contacted BaFin (no issues with my nationality). As a matter of fact, I was able to open my investment accounts with comdirect and Consorsbank. What rules you follow is beyond me. You need to review your policies. ,Botton line: lots of poor experiences. Mobile app is great, but everything around it is really not in good shape.",,/users/5481beef00006400019b4b37,8,DE

Good if you need a bank account fast.,"I have had two serious issues with N26 customer support that would make me think twice about recommending them. Generally, the problem is customer support doesn't have more information than the FAQ, so if you can't solve the problem yourself, good luck reaching a person who can help you.,1. I transfered a my savings in the US to Germany. My bank said the transfer had completed but N26 told me that they had not received the money and that I should check with the sender. Ok, major life stress that my savings had been lost in transfer. A week later, I received a notification that the money had been received the previous week (when they told me they hadn't received it) and N26 needed some tax / anti-fraud documentation. I had already spent a week hunting down a problem outside of N26, when the problem was internal and Customer Support is instructed to tell customers to fend for themselves.,2. I recently messed up my taxes and my account was garnished (apparently my Steuerberater failed to forward me a mahnung). Same song and dance. What would be something resolved in 24-48 hours at another bank is ongoing and taking more than a week to resolve. Again, contacting their customer service involves them telling me what I already know then terminating chat. I'm lucky my friends will feed me while I can't pay for groceries.,I still think N26 is great for the convenience / speed of setting up an account, but for someone planning on staying in Germany long-term, I'd recommend you open up an account at a reputable bank with real customer service.",,/users/5be313f15483f4b8a9889e04,4,DE

Until a week ago when the account got blocked out of the blue. Since then we’re finding out that N26 has a huge security gap and horrendous customer service. ,Fraud number on the bank of the MasterCard leads to automated voicemail pointing to chat. Every other bank has a fraud helpline. And where did phone support go? Now it’s only through chat or email. Different chat agents give different information, all chats are shut down without real help. Email reply takes 2 days and contain standard phrases pointing either to chat or to mysterious email sent earlier. ,After 6 days insisting via @N26_support on Twitter an email gets forwarded that chat agents claimed we should have received but that never arrived. The email contains standard blurb about cancellation due to misuse etc AND it was sent to a new fraudulous email address.

What good is fingerprint login when a simple email change allows fraud?,To be clear. We’ve been home all that time, app and card safe 24/7, We use the account to pay bills and receive salary.

Each staff member seems to have different instructions on how to verify their customers; one insisted I had to provide the details of my STOLEN passport before he would update anything or help me, even though I hadn't had the passport for 4 months. When shipping me my card, they messed the address up TWICE. It took me almost a month to get my card! I've now closed my account and stuck with just Transferwise as their overall service and product is much more refined, user-friendly and really just offers a better total package.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2019-03-01T09:13:27.000Z,Not a good start and not really ready…,"Not a good start and not really ready for service.,The process of opening the account was slick and seamless using the cam on the phone to capture proof documentation needed, account number immediately available, very fast push notifications via the app of payments in and out. ,The app (what there is of it) is slick and a couple of nice touches like swiping over the camera to blur out figures if your in a public place),However this is where it breaks down a bit, despite stating on the website 5 - 14 days to receive your debit card (which already feels long compared with standard banks) after 14 days I get an email stating due to logistical problems it could be up to another two weeks, but hopefully not that long, at the end of the two weeks I complained via twitter got another email saying sorry they were having logistical problems it could be another week. So five weeks in and no sign of getting a debit card, given they don’t offer check books this makes the account pretty much useless. ,They don’t participate in the account switch service (presumably they don’t want people leaving easily when they realise how atrocious their service is) which means you have to manually visit each of your DD,s and manually switch them to your new account ( a process I have stopped till I’m sure I’m going to remain a customer) ,Once you do get DD’s into the account there is no way on the website or app to manage them or cancel them, if reports I have read are true you have to get a form, fill in details that are hard to get often involving you contacting the DD payee to ask for details, sign it and send it to support.,Given they are new into the market you may also find companies can’t accept them yet as a DD source although hopefully that will resolve its self fairly soon, so far about a third of my DD’s could not accept N26 as a source. ,There is no way to manage regular payee’s that I can see. ,If reports I have read are true, if you try to cancel your account until their service matures you are slapped with a lifetime ban.,I have read reports of payments (IN) being late or delayed in their systems meaning people default on their outbound payments for bills and mortgages. ,They do not have a 24 x 7 customer service team and if reports I have read are anything to go by their support team have not been educated on the basics of customer service (although I have not experienced this first hand),If you hold or want a euro account they can’t give you a second GBP account. ,Despite the UK market feeling like a lack lustre launch was botched and still waiting for basics to be fixed like getting a card, systems working reliably, and basic banking functions still needing to be enabled, N26 have made big announcements of moving on to its next markets in Brazil and the US. ,In summary - does not feel like a professional outfit, feels like a start up which is not what you want from a bank. I think they are trying to move when they are not ready. In my opinion they are not ready to take over as your primary bank, personally I’m just going to use them as a payment processor for some of my transactions. I started with plans to compleay switch my banking to them but I don’t feel like they are in any way ready for that. They need to do a lot of work on the customer service and realise they are dealing with people’s money, they WILL get mad if you fail to meet your obligations, that goes with the territory and being unable to answer questions in a knolagable way or closing chat windows before customers have finished is not going to win you and good will. ,They need to review their lifetime ban policy when customers decide (probably quite justifiably) that N26 are not ready for service yet. ,They probably should look at not charging yet even for their metal accounts until they really are truly ready to be called a bank with all the basic services. ,They need to get to at least the basic standards of banking functionality, like managing payees DD’s and SO’s before they call themselves a bank. ,They need to plan and evacuate launches much better than they did the UK. ,In my opinion they need to form a customer opinion group and take notice of the feedback they are receiving. ,Finally my advice by all means try them but don’t rely on them, and don’t make my mistake and sign up for their paid for service thinking you can switch to them, they are no way ready to be a bank.","Hey Dale,,Thanks for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

This makes it even better, because most banks are jerks and block something if you are jailbroken.

Furthermore, the design of both app and website is literally amazing. But, I'm not rating it 5 stars only because of some things that I would love for them to improve or add. The Mastercard Secure system that is linked to your card and their app is abysmal! It rarely works, and when I make purchases they go right through, which is quite disturbing, and it feels like my security is breached while shopping online. Also, I'd love to see the multicurrency option on the N26 platform, because it's a huge plus! Apart from all of this, the BANK IS AMAZING! And the bad reviews given here are just from people who had trouble getting verified so they throw shade on it, and describe it with such negativity that the bank actually doesn't have!

It seems that as they grow in size their client support is decreasing. When it comes to resolving problems with my money, I do not appreciate speaking automated chat robots or being told that my bank cannot do anything for me with out causing me great inconvenience. I think banks and other financial institutions should remember that it is our money that allows them to stay in business, so it may be a good idea to protect your clients assets..

For me, they refused to credit a chunky deposit to my account - even though I had asked in advance if this was ok and provided evidence of where it came from.  It took two weeks to resolve. And through all that time it was impossible to get any replies from their Back Office staff. The in-app chat people are generally friendly but seem disconnected from the actual banking staff, so are of little help in these situations. And there is no phone number available to try and actually talk to someone. ,I wrote a formal complaint to their banking CEO Markus Gunter - no reply.,I messaged their CEO Valentin Stalf on Linkedin - no reply.,In the end they reversed the deposit payment, so at least I got my money back in the end.,And now today I get an email saying my account was being terminated. Well that's just peachy.,So no attempt from them to really look at the problem or raise any dialogue with me to find a solution.

From my experience it really wasn’t. ,In the end it got activated so I thought I’d give N26 a go. What a terrible mistake that was. ,Most banks in the UK now support faster payments, meaning that if somebody sends you money, majority of the time it’ll be with you in seconds, again for me it wasn’t. Two different people wired me significant sums of money which when I went on chat to N26 support to see where my money was they told me it could take up to two hours. ,So I waited...and nothing. I then got told that due to some regulations it can actually take up to the next working day, which really frustrated me as I’d been onto chat about 5 times at this point and been given different answers. ,Luckily the money cleared another few hours later into the account. ,So, like any normal person I needed to make a couple of purchases on the net, first purchase went through fine, second one not so much. The card kept getting declined, over and over and over again. I had been onto N26 support about 10 different times at this point (I got many answers saying that the cards been unlocked and wait ten minutes, to blames on the retailer, until the last advisor just gave up and blamed MasterCard). ,I don’t say this lightly but N26 is the worst FinTech bank I know of. It’s just all marketing and a slick interface. Support and actual use of the account is terrible, it’s unfinished and needs a lot of work. ,When a bank can’t even provide its users with basic banking functions, like transferring money and spending you know to stay away.,I’ve used Starling, Monzo and Revlout and they’re great.

When I joined N26, I thought I would be relieved of annoying bank policies that made no sense. I thought N26 was more transparent, helpful and dynamic. I was happy when I received my free card and decided to upgrade to Black. That would make it even better, right?,Well, it turned out I was wrong. N26 isn’t quite in the business of making a better bank experience for customers, it’s rather in the ‘make money quick’ business. This has been evident to me through various experiences.,First of all, don’t bother contacting Customer Support. They will be able to chat FAQ answers to you, but won’t go an inch father for you. My card broke after about 7 months, I’ve never had something like that before (as in their cards would last years) with my previous banks. I contacted N26 Support in the hope they could do something for me since I had been a Black member for a while, but all they could do was refer to the app and indicate that I had to pay.,N26 tries to lock you into contracts.

Everything worked fine until this week. ,* Get ready that you will be investigated like terrorist for ordinary amounts of money from/to your closest family member /in EU/.

Great. €800 left. I tried again with €800 and it said rejected. ,Then I got idea to try ATM of different bank, so I went to Raiffeisen Vienna with €500 withdrawal and bingo! Now it started to be exciting. €300 left. I went to Erste ATM, tried €200, it said: daily limit overrun. I opened N26 app and my daily limit was 1600. Strange math, but I raised it to 2500 and finally Erste gave me €200. Tomorrow I will ask N26 to close my account, so I have left them €100 in case they want to charge me €63 for that plastic card of value of €2.50.,I would never say that one day I will experience that feeling of 1929, when you get your own money from the bank and you feel like you just won the lottery.",,/users/5bb8621a4de5666d344533cb,1,SK

BaFin responded immediately, asking me to file a complaint as they informed me that terminating bank accounts in German banks requires at least two months notice; thus it appears that N26's action to terminate with a shorter notice is illegal., ,The account was operating fine past N26's deadline so I thought that everything is fine thanks to BaFin’s intervention. I received my payroll money there, did a transfer,  but as I went to withdraw 2000 euros my account was blocked. 10 days ago they informed me that my account has been indeed terminated. They offered to transfer my moneys (over 2500 euros) to another account. I provided them the account number on the 1st of August but they have kept the moneys. Their customer “support” is unable to provide me with details about when the transfer will take place; they continuously say that my request is with their “backoffice”.

N26,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,2019-10-11T18:57:09.000Z,Internet Bank with growing pains,"Key facts: ,- N26 doesn’t save you from private fees of some ATMs (in my case 6 EUR for withdrawing 10 EUR),- customer support is slow in responding via email and I mean really slow: at least 8 days no answer,- waiting time for reaching the customer support chat agent is at least 30 - 45 min waiting,- slow response time of the customer support reps in the chat app as well,- application is buggy,- customer support can’t read about previous issues you had with the company, even if it was just an hour ago, which shows that they have some serious system issues,Update October 2019: N26 resolved the issues mentioned above, except the ATM fees, customer service works better now, even though they still can’t help you to solve standard issues quickly,Long story:,First, N26 is not offering entirely free withdrawals, something you don’t expect from a company that openly advertises their free withdrawals at any ATM. Once I was withdrawing 10 EUR on an ATM in a Kiosk and was impatiently clicking through their never ending amount of questions, confidently knowing that I don’t need to pay withdrawal fees anywhere I ignored whatever was written there, ten questions later I was finally able to withdraw my 10 EUR and received a notification from the N26 app that 16 EUR were withdrawn from my account… wait a second… 16 EUR? Holy ****, I just paid 60% to withdraw some money. I was then trying to reach N26 customer support how it can happen that I have to pay fees while I am in my NO FEE withdrawal limit, after 20 minutes waiting I lost my internet connection and after reconnecting I couldn’t even find the chat icon anymore, so I wrote an email and then again… waiting… after eight days waiting and checking several times in the app if the chat icon would reappear in the support section, I was finally lucky, the chat icon came back and again I contacted the customer support team and waited in line … for 30 minutes! Once I finally reached the customer support team I was told that there are exceptions and of course, I would find them in the fine print… well if I had only known that before. ,Second, the app is not always working, for instance when you want to pay something online in an online shop and you get prompted to approve the transaction in your app, but instead, when you open your app, you receive an error message. So you contact the customer support… and again… you wait for 30 min… then finally it was my turn and the customer support rep told me to reinstall the app, which I did, and again, the same error pops up, so again I contact the customer support and again wait for 30 minutes. No, not this time, this time I even waited for 45 minutes… however, the customer support rep told me that he is not able to read about the previous issue and I have to explain him the entire problem again, after explaining him the problem again he told me that he can’t help me with this issue and I shall contact the support team via email with detailed information about my phone maker and model. I was pretty surprised by that answer because I don’t even have an exotic smartphone, just a usual iPhone 7.,Overall N26 bank feels like a cheap and buggy budget airline which has a pretty design but you can feel that they save money on every corner of the business, for instance as mentioned above, customer service, missing system capabilities and application stability. After this experience I decided that I will move on to another online bank. They should have saved the money on marketing and invest it in customer support and a good DevOps team.,Update October 2019: if you haven’t paired your N26 app to your phone you can’t approve online payments at some occasions, an error message shows up that something unexpected happened and that they are looking into it (which they actually don’t do, otherwise customer service would be aware of it) a standard issue, the customer service though is still not aware of that.

N26,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2018-05-15T16:37:50.000Z,Avoid N26 if you don't want frustration in your daily life.,"N26 really wants to be ""the app bank"" and disrupt old fashioned banking by offering a sleek and affordable service. But they are failing to do so and have not yet realised that they've become what they say they want to disrupt: a conventional bank.,The app has many bugs. 3D secure often doesn't work. Sometimes payments don't work. Other times the debit card doesn't work. Duplicate charges for the same thing happens every now and then. There are issues with payments where the card needs to be authorised and an amount booked: I've experienced paying for gas, 100€ was booked, I only bought 30€ worth of gas, but it took about a week for the remainder 70€ to be refunded.,Banking needs to just work and you need to feel safe and secure and trust that you will be able to make easy quick payments at any time. N26 is not like that and often you will be frustrated by all the things that don't exactly work seamlessly. You will often have to uninstall the app, unlink your smartphone, reinstall the app, re-link your smartphone in order to get things to work. Too bad of you're trying to buy a ticket for a train leaving in 5 minutes or if you're standing at a coffee shop trying to pay, with a long queue of people behind you.,At least you know that when things don't work, there's a team of skilled and helpful customer support agents ready to chat with you at any time. NOT! N26 is the company where I've experienced the rudest, most inefficient and careless customer support in my life. They have no empathy and will rather insult your intelligence than admit something is wrong on their side. If you have a an issue that's just a little more complex than a simple question about the product, it will take several months to resolve your issue. Emails are not answered and sometimes the same email is answered by several different agents, all saying something different. There is no connection between the customer support you receive though chat, phone an email, for each of these you will have a different ticket number.,N26 also has the habit of changing terms and conditions and pricing quite often and in many cases you won't even be informed or asked to accept the changes. Let's say live in Spain and you've signed up to be a customer in Spain but N26 has repeatedly failed to deliver your debit card and for the 3rd attempt you happen to be in another country for a month and ask for the card to be delivered there: the terms and conditions and pricing applied to your account will be changed from Spain to that other country you happen to be in, and you will not even be informed about this.,I recommend you to look elsewhere, if what you want is a sleek modern bank that just works and that has your back.","Hey John, we're sorry you've experienced such hassles using N26. ,The application functions by pairing a phone to it and this pairing quality can vary with certain models or makes, which explains why uninstalling the app and repairing your phone is necessary and efficient. ,Card transactions always happen in two steps.

I imagine a less tech savvy person to spend a lot of time on this, or simply failing to sign up.,It's just a very slow and needlessly complicated process. When you visit a bank, they don't analyze your passport quality in detail.,But it accepts people from many nations across Europe, so it's one of few banks that actually creates almost pan-European competition. This is very positive, hope they expand the offer to all EEA nations.,The bank has a free MasterCard debit card, but offers no savings account. Also it limits number of free withdrawals. So DKB bank is normally a better option, or Ferratum. But Ferratum only accepts people BORN in the nation where they reside! So if you have German passport and live in Belgium, you cannot open an account. Only if you ALWAYS live in Germany until death :-) This is just absurd, at least n26 is not that absurd. But I do read that non-Europeans living in Europe are blocked, like people with Indian passports.,I like that transactions are dated also by time, so you know when money arrives on your account - not just by date.

The payments and money transfer were all ok, that's why I recommended it to 2 of my friends via the ""Invite Friends"" program. Both friends ordered the card and topped it up with money. And then the story starts to complicate. The ""Invite Friends"" promises to give you (me) 15€ for each friend (and it was 30€ during the Christmas time). I NEVER saw this money. Contacted the support team and they say the ""Invite Friends"" program currently doesn't work. I don't care if it currently doesn't work - it worked (or at least was presented as working) when I invited my friends. And besides - although they said the program currently doesn't work they are still misleading the customers with 15€ reward on an ""Invite Friends"" page. At least they should remove that statement. ,Honestly, I'm quite disappointed with the customer service, especially because they're a bank and shouldn't afford such flaws.

Their partnership with Allianz is all talk: good luck getting a response if you have a claim and N26 won't do anything to help. Their partnership with Clark is useless. They don't manage anything for you. It takes up to a week to get email support responses and they usually just apologize but not solve your problem. But what really annoyed me most is it takes over two weeks to get a new card in the mail. They actually deactivated my old card before I received my new card and so I had online payments bouncing and all types of drama.

N26,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,2017-12-29T10:24:02.000Z,One of the Best Banks Out There,"N26 is one of the best banks I've ever used. Personally, I find big traditional banks highly repulsive, so an efficient online bank was the obvious choice. Here's how it compares to Revolut. ,Most importantly for me, N26 processes its card payments using the Mastercard rate, which is much better than the infamous in-house Revolut one. In other words, for every 100 EUR foreign currency payment I make using the Revolut card, I lose roughly 1 EUR versus if I made it using the N26 card. ,In addition, certain online retailers (including some in the UK) couldn't process the payment made by the Revolut card, while the N26 card worked just fine. It might have to do with Revolut card being Prepaid versus N26 card being Debit. ,This is purely personal preference, but I find the N26 Mastercard to be much more visually appealing than the Revolut one. Although, quite the opposite is true for their premium cards. ,N26 also has a better customer service",,/users/5a4617bf0000ff000af7c18e,2,CH

They send you their articles that explain that you should use Transferwise but don't say that they don't support SWIFT.,The result - worse exchange rate, paid commission and you have to exchange your money back to local currency and then back to Euro. Other reviews have mentioned the long time it takes to get the money - they said it should ""probably take 10 days"". They don't know how their systems work and they don't want to pass my complaint to a higher authority.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2017-11-21T20:10:23.000Z,Nice concept but awful operation,"The basic idea of N26 is quite nice. It's very handy for daily use apart from one thing; their debit card is not that weird German ""EC Karte"" so some shops and restaurants refuse your N26 debit card. But it's ok since I hate this crappy format anyway and avoid shops who only accept them as much as possible.,The real problems with N26 are the investment account and their customer support.,Obviously they have way too less support staff in terms of both number and qualification. When I had a problem (which is not yet solved btw) and wrote an email to them, I got a response 10 days later. And the response was like ""we will investigate the issue and get back to you when we have any updates"", which provides no information.,And the problem with the investment account is even worse. The app says it takes 3-5 days to open an investment account. Now I still don't have my account after 2 month. I've been writing to them via email and chat every week and I've been always getting responses like ""It will take a week more"" or ""I reckon it will be fixed in a couple of days"" but all of them turned out to be false.,In conclusion; basic idea and features are cool, but the CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE. They are too friendly even in case of very serious problem, they lie and they do nothing to solve the problem.",,/users/5a1485dd0000ff000ae5d94e,1,US

Looks cool, but lacks transparency. ,I opened an account online and went through the entire registration process. I went for the black option, and expected to be able to receive my salary there. I selected Spain as my country of residence, as they recently opened there. ,To my surprise, once the registration process was finalized, I received a german IBAN, when I was expecting a spanish one. Nowhere was it clearly stated during the registration process that this would be a german IBAN.  Even though Spanish businesses are lawfully obliged to accept SEPA IBANs, most of them refuse non-spanish ones. So I got stuck with this German IBAN, and could not cancel the contract until at least the end of the 1st year. ,After contacting customer support, I was told that there is a 14 days cancellation period. I was never informed of this by the registration officer, even though I clearly stated my problem. ,Summary: Disappointed by the lack of transparency, and the lack of flexibility when addressing directly my problem to the customer service.

N26,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2017-04-29T01:30:35.000Z,App is anything but innovative in 2016-2017,"I joined after the migration mess and I live in NL. At first i was drinking the coolaid and recommended everyone to join this bank. I travel a lot. But man, this is actually a much more old fashioned bank than traditional banks! Reason: (1) their app might have been cool when in launched in 2015, it has been surpassed easily in 2016 by the apps of all traditional banks, at least the ones I know like ING. (2) customer service is non-existent, i have a pending issue since early January, they have been dead silent for 9 weeks now. ,To elaborate on point 1:,1A their app is anything but intuitive. Forget what well-known tech and finance blogs write. It's simply not true. The app is slow, doesn't have a clear visual when it's loading, scrolling through your expenses can be horrible unless you have a very fast 4G connection all the time, the filter feature is very cool but completely hidden by a button barely visible after you hit the search button (i bet 90% of the users don't even know it exists).,1B There are also real problems with the app. For instance, unlike any other (debit) creditcard app, N26 is the *ONLY* app in the world that does not distinguish CC authorizations/reservations from actual payments. This can lead to serious problems. You could for example see 4 payments to  1 hotel, same amount each, not knowing which one was the payment, if any (!) And not knowing what the hell is going on. Even Amex totally crap 1980 style app clearly marks authorisations.,1C not all users experience this showstopper issue but I certainly do (on Android): you cannot save account numbers. Normally N26 will store the account number but only after a successful payment has been made. Unfortunately i have used the app for 6 months now, no account number has been stored. And having to type in all bank details every time i need to pay for a service or send someone money is extremely annoying! I have send screenshots and details of this bug 5 months ago, got a confirmation from Support they would forward it to the right department. I have emailed them 4 times since, no response. ,With all app updates since 2015, no actual useful features have been introduced. N26 app is the *LEAST INNOVATIVE* app of 2016 and so far 2017. Their Dutch (now going European) competitor BUNQ bank is actually doing much better with an innovative app that receives useful updates with new features all the time + BUNQ has realtime, in-app, real-person (no bot) Customer Service! It's just their business model (and price, paying a couple of cents for each local payment became too expensive for me ) that still keeps me using N26 mostly.,As an example of missing innovation: ,BUNQ introduced a feature that will hold all pre-authorised monthly payments (like ISP, Netflix, energy etc) , an Android notification comes in requiring you to confirm these payments. The first time you approve, you have the ability to approve all feature pre-auth payments and even set a limit so if your mobile phone provider suddenly charge you double, it will be blocked and you will have to confirm it first. This is how payments should be! This is something N26 should have come up with in 2016. But they didn't. ,But knowing all this, i still use N26 for 2 simple reasons:,1: it is free and cheaper than other banks when traveling (I use it together with Revolut).,2: it gives realtime info on your CC (although not being able to see if it's an authorisation is extremely bad).,So it is definitely usable and if you just need the cheapest possible bank, this will do but be aware of extremely bad Support (basically non existent), an old, non-intuitive app, no way to identify authorisations, and no improvements to the app for over a year. Fix all the above and you'll have happy customers instead of just a huge amount of new customers and angry old customers. ,Black:,The paid subscription (N26 Black) is absolutely not worth it, it doesn't solve any of the mentioned issues so it's a no go. It is not available in NL yet but I have read the German offering thoroughly and definitely not worth it, as travel insurance there are much better similar prices options (even cheaper). But i guess people are used to the buyer protection with their old CC's and that's what makes them choose Black.",,/users/5903ea260000ff000a92687b,1,NL

I've chosen for N26, as the bank for my international travels and international transactions, as my Maestro card from another bank was a hassle to use abroad. Using the Debit Mastercard from N26 I won't have any problems using ATMs abroad, which is a big plus. The app is good, and the second money is deducted from your account, it gives you a notificaiton on your phone, so your're always aware of what is happening to your money. ,The bank is less personal than traditional bank, due to its all online service, and therefore might rise suspicion that it is a scam by some people.

Yes, it has had some teething issues and I too was irritated by the transfer from Wirebank when they achieved their own banking licence, but it has vastly improved since that time. I was disappointed that charges are to be introduced, but I can see that near dormant accounts are of little use to anyone, so will happily pay the new charge as I believe their quality of service is generally good.,My only concern is that as time has progressed the customer service is getting worse. There is an arrogance that wasn't there before and messages such as ""We are very busy and there will be a delay ...etc"" don't give me confidence. The last time I contacted them, I had to wait for 4 days for a reply - after sending a reminder. Not good enough for an online bank.,I still recommend N26 although I have knocked one star off this review.

It was a fresh take on banking and we all know that we need something fresh when it comes to banking since regular banks just suck.,I knew that there would be some troubles since N26 is a startup and still growing but boy I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But one thing after another.,First of all I really don't like the fact that they release new unstable features. Guys this is supposed to be a god damn bank and not some toy that I don't mind if it stops working for a day or two. A lot of their stuff either doesn't work at all, isn't supported in your country or is ""temporarily unavailable and they are working on fixing the issue"",See the problem with that is that I need my bank account to work. I don't care what kind of problems you have. Every bank manages to run smoothly but N26 just simply doesn't work pretty often. They have issues where you cannot access your account or even sometimes not use your card at all because of internal issues.,Second I want to rant about the ""MasterCard"" which is not a real MasterCard as they state it. It is not accepted in a lot of places which say that they accept MasterCard payments. This applies to online shops and local stores.,My worst experience so far was by far my trip to England. There I apparently got scamed ? All my money was taken from my account because it seems like some guy withdraw all my money at an ATM even though I haven't lost my card. Despite being broke and stuck with no money at all in England for four weeks I called N26 (Had to call them 4 times because I was waiting for about 1 hour each in their line because apparently they don't have enough workers) and the gentlemen told me not to worry locked my card and send me a new one at my address back at home and he ensured me that I will get my money back within 14 days since it was not me who took out the money.,3 months and 10 calls later I got my money back... (I didn't actually expect to get it back after 3 months but I was positively surprised) so I started spending money again yay.,2 days later they took the money away again and there I was sitting with a negative account balance without even activating the feature to go below zero. I called them again and they once again told me to wait 14 days. ,2 months later I got my money back again but this time I was done with this god damn bank and about to close my account.,After some research I found out that a lot of people got scamed like me with an N26 account. Some of them from the exact same merchant as me which I find very shady but if you ask N26 directly they of course just tell you that it is a coincidence.,Besides that everything that seemed to make N26 appealing was taken away with the new bank accounts.,Now the free tier doesn't offer free international withdrawals anymore and I find it interesting that the free account doesn't cover ATM withdrawal theft anymore which is a huge warning sign for me. ,You have to pay for the premium card if you want to protect yourself from theft which is absurd.,I could go on and on and on but I think you get the bigger picture.,N26 is a joke.
